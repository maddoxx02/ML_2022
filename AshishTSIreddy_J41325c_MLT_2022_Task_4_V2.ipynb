       "'\\ufeffCHAPTER I.\\nDown the Rabbit-Hole\\n\\n\\nAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\\nbank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into\\nthe book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or\\nconversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice\\n“without pictures or conversations?”\\n\\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\\nhot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of\\nmaking a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\\npicking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\\nclose by her.\\n\\nThere was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it\\nso _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh\\ndear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards,\\nit occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\\ntime it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\\nwatch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\\non, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\\nhad never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\\nwatch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\\nlarge rabbit-hole under the hedge.\\n\\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\\nin the world she was to get out again.\\n\\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\\ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\\ndeep well.\\n\\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\\nplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\\nwas going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out\\nwhat she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\\nlooked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\\ncupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\\nhung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\\npassed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great\\ndisappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\\nof killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\\ncupboards as she fell past it.\\n\\n“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall\\nthink nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me\\nat home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the\\ntop of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)\\n\\nDown, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? “I wonder how\\nmany miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be\\ngetting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would\\nbe four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt\\nseveral things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\\nthough this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her\\nknowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\\npractice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but\\nthen I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no\\nidea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice\\ngrand words to say.)\\n\\nPresently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right _through_\\nthe earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk\\nwith their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather\\nglad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all\\nthe right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the\\ncountry is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?”\\n(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy _curtseying_ as you’re\\nfalling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what\\nan ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do\\nto ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”\\n\\nDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\\ntalking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!”\\n(Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at\\ntea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are\\nno mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s\\nvery like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here\\nAlice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a\\ndreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and\\nsometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer\\neither question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt\\nthat she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was\\nwalking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,\\n“Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly,\\nthump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and\\nthe fall was over.\\n\\nAlice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:\\nshe looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another\\nlong passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down\\nit. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,\\nand was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears\\nand whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she\\nturned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\\nfrom the roof.\\n\\nThere were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\\nAlice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\\ndoor, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\\nget out again.\\n\\nSuddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\\nglass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s\\nfirst thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\\nbut, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\\nbut at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second\\ntime round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\\nbehind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\\nlittle golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\\n\\nAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\\nmuch larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the\\npassage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get\\nout of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright\\nflowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head\\nthrough the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought\\npoor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,\\nhow I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only\\nknew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had\\nhappened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things\\nindeed were really impossible.\\n\\nThere seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\\nback to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\\nany rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\\ntime she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here\\nbefore,” said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\\nlabel, with the words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed on it in large\\nletters.\\n\\nIt was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was\\nnot going to do _that_ in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said,\\n“and see whether it’s marked ‘_poison_’ or not”; for she had read\\nseveral nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and\\neaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they\\n_would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:\\nsuch as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;\\nand that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually\\nbleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a\\nbottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you,\\nsooner or later.\\n\\nHowever, this bottle was _not_ marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to\\ntaste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed\\nflavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and\\nhot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\\n\\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n\\n“What a curious feeling!” said Alice; “I must be shutting up like a\\ntelescope.”\\n\\nAnd so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face\\nbrightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going\\nthrough the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she\\nwaited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:\\nshe felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,”\\nsaid Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle. I\\nwonder what I should be like then?” And she tried to fancy what the\\nflame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could\\nnot remember ever having seen such a thing.\\n\\nAfter a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going\\ninto the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the\\ndoor, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she\\nwent back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach\\nit: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her\\nbest to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\\nand when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing\\nsat down and cried.\\n\\n“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself,\\nrather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally\\ngave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),\\nand sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into\\nher eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having\\ncheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,\\nfor this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.\\n“But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two\\npeople! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable\\nperson!”\\n\\nSoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:\\nshe opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words\\n“EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants. “Well, I’ll eat it,” said\\nAlice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it\\nmakes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll\\nget into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”\\n\\nShe ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which\\nway?”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was\\ngrowing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\\nsize: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice\\nhad got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way\\nthings to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go\\non in the common way.\\n\\nSo she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.\\n\\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\nThe Pool of Tears\\n\\n\\n“Curiouser and curiouser!” cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that\\nfor the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); “now I’m\\nopening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!”\\n(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of\\nsight, they were getting so far off). “Oh, my poor little feet, I\\nwonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I’m\\nsure _I_ shan’t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble\\nmyself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be\\nkind to them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps they won’t walk the way I\\nwant to go! Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every\\nChristmas.”\\n\\nAnd she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. “They must\\ngo by the carrier,” she thought; “and how funny it’ll seem, sending\\npresents to one’s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!\\n\\n     _Alice’s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with\\n     Alice’s love_).\\n\\nOh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!”\\n\\nJust then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was\\nnow more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden\\nkey and hurried off to the garden door.\\n\\nPoor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to\\nlook through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more\\nhopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.\\n\\n“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Alice, “a great girl like\\nyou,” (she might well say this), “to go on crying in this way! Stop\\nthis moment, I tell you!” But she went on all the same, shedding\\ngallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about\\nfour inches deep and reaching half down the hall.\\n\\nAfter a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and\\nshe hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White\\nRabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves\\nin one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a\\ngreat hurry, muttering to himself as he came, “Oh! the Duchess, the\\nDuchess! Oh! won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!” Alice felt\\nso desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the\\nRabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, “If you please,\\nsir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and\\nthe fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.\\n\\nAlice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she\\nkept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: “Dear, dear! How\\nqueer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.\\nI wonder if I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the\\nsame when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling\\na little different. But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who\\nin the world am I? Ah, _that’s_ the great puzzle!” And she began\\nthinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as\\nherself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.\\n\\n“I’m sure I’m not Ada,” she said, “for her hair goes in such long\\nringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t\\nbe Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a\\nvery little! Besides, _she’s_ she, and _I’m_ I, and—oh dear, how\\npuzzling it all is! I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know.\\nLet me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,\\nand four times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that\\nrate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn’t signify: let’s try\\nGeography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of\\nRome, and Rome—no, _that’s_ all wrong, I’m certain! I must have been\\nchanged for Mabel! I’ll try and say ‘_How doth the little_—’” and she\\ncrossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began\\nto repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words\\ndid not come the same as they used to do:—\\n\\n“How doth the little crocodile\\n    Improve his shining tail,\\nAnd pour the waters of the Nile\\n    On every golden scale!\\n\\n“How cheerfully he seems to grin,\\n    How neatly spread his claws,\\nAnd welcome little fishes in\\n    With gently smiling jaws!”\\n\\n\\n“I’m sure those are not the right words,” said poor Alice, and her eyes\\nfilled with tears again as she went on, “I must be Mabel after all, and\\nI shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to\\nno toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I’ve\\nmade up my mind about it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here! It’ll be\\nno use their putting their heads down and saying ‘Come up again, dear!’\\nI shall only look up and say ‘Who am I then? Tell me that first, and\\nthen, if I like being that person, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down\\nhere till I’m somebody else’—but, oh dear!” cried Alice, with a sudden\\nburst of tears, “I do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so\\n_very_ tired of being all alone here!”\\n\\nAs she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see\\nthat she had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while\\nshe was talking. “How _can_ I have done that?” she thought. “I must be\\ngrowing small again.” She got up and went to the table to measure\\nherself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was\\nnow about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon\\nfound out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she\\ndropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.\\n\\n“That _was_ a narrow escape!” said Alice, a good deal frightened at the\\nsudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; “and\\nnow for the garden!” and she ran with all speed back to the little\\ndoor: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden\\nkey was lying on the glass table as before, “and things are worse than\\never,” thought the poor child, “for I never was so small as this\\nbefore, never! And I declare it’s too bad, that it is!”\\n\\nAs she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,\\nsplash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that\\nshe had somehow fallen into the sea, “and in that case I can go back by\\nrailway,” she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in\\nher life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go\\nto on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the\\nsea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row\\nof lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she\\nsoon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when\\nshe was nine feet high.\\n\\n“I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice, as she swam about, trying\\nto find her way out. “I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by\\nbeing drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be\\nsure! However, everything is queer to-day.”\\n\\nJust then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\\noff, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought\\nit must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\\nshe was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\\nslipped in like herself.\\n\\n“Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak to this mouse?\\nEverything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very\\nlikely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.” So she\\nbegan: “O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired\\nof swimming about here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be the right\\nway of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but\\nshe remembered having seen in her brother’s Latin Grammar, “A mouse—of\\na mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!”) The Mouse looked at her rather\\ninquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\\nbut it said nothing.\\n\\n“Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,” thought Alice; “I daresay it’s\\na French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.” (For, with all\\nher knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago\\nanything had happened.) So she began again: “Où est ma chatte?” which\\nwas the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a\\nsudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with\\nfright. “Oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice hastily, afraid that she\\nhad hurt the poor animal’s feelings. “I quite forgot you didn’t like\\ncats.”\\n\\n“Not like cats!” cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. “Would\\n_you_ like cats if you were me?”\\n\\n“Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry\\nabout it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d\\ntake a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear\\nquiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about\\nin the pool, “and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her\\npaws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to\\nnurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your\\npardon!” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all\\nover, and she felt certain it must be really offended. “We won’t talk\\nabout her any more if you’d rather not.”\\n\\n“We indeed!” cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his\\ntail. “As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always\\n_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don’t let me hear the name\\nagain!”\\n\\n“I won’t indeed!” said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\\nconversation. “Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?” The Mouse did not\\nanswer, so Alice went on eagerly: “There is such a nice little dog near\\nour house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you\\nknow, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it’ll fetch things when\\nyou throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts\\nof things—I can’t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you\\nknow, and he says it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds! He says\\nit kills all the rats and—oh dear!” cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,\\n“I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!” For the Mouse was swimming away\\nfrom her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the\\npool as it went.\\n\\nSo she called softly after it, “Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we\\nwon’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them!” When the\\nMouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face\\nwas quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low\\ntrembling voice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my\\nhistory, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.”\\n\\nIt was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the\\nbirds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a\\nDodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice\\nled the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\nA Caucus-Race and a Long Tale\\n\\n\\nThey were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the\\nbirds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close\\nto them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.\\n\\nThe first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a\\nconsultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite\\nnatural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if\\nshe had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument\\nwith the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, “I am\\nolder than you, and must know better;” and this Alice would not allow\\nwithout knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to\\ntell its age, there was no more to be said.\\n\\nAt last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,\\ncalled out, “Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! _I’ll_ soon make\\nyou dry enough!” They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the\\nMouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she\\nfelt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.\\n\\n“Ahem!” said the Mouse with an important air, “are you all ready? This\\nis the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! ‘William\\nthe Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted\\nto by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much\\naccustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of\\nMercia and Northumbria—’”\\n\\n“Ugh!” said the Lory, with a shiver.\\n\\n“I beg your pardon!” said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: “Did\\nyou speak?”\\n\\n“Not I!” said the Lory hastily.\\n\\n“I thought you did,” said the Mouse. “—I proceed. ‘Edwin and Morcar,\\nthe earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even\\nStigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable—’”\\n\\n“Found _what_?” said the Duck.\\n\\n“Found _it_,” the Mouse replied rather crossly: “of course you know\\nwhat ‘it’ means.”\\n\\n“I know what ‘it’ means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,” said the\\nDuck: “it’s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the\\narchbishop find?”\\n\\nThe Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, “‘—found\\nit advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him\\nthe crown. William’s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence\\nof his Normans—’ How are you getting on now, my dear?” it continued,\\nturning to Alice as it spoke.\\n\\n“As wet as ever,” said Alice in a melancholy tone: “it doesn’t seem to\\ndry me at all.”\\n\\n“In that case,” said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, “I move\\nthat the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic\\nremedies—”\\n\\n“Speak English!” said the Eaglet. “I don’t know the meaning of half\\nthose long words, and, what’s more, I don’t believe you do either!” And\\nthe Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds\\ntittered audibly.\\n\\n“What I was going to say,” said the Dodo in an offended tone, “was,\\nthat the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.”\\n\\n“What _is_ a Caucus-race?” said Alice; not that she wanted much to\\nknow, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to\\nspeak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.\\n\\n“Why,” said the Dodo, “the best way to explain it is to do it.” (And,\\nas you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will\\ntell you how the Dodo managed it.)\\n\\nFirst it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (“the exact\\nshape doesn’t matter,” it said,) and then all the party were placed\\nalong the course, here and there. There was no “One, two, three, and\\naway,” but they began running when they liked, and left off when they\\nliked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,\\nwhen they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry\\nagain, the Dodo suddenly called out “The race is over!” and they all\\ncrowded round it, panting, and asking, “But who has won?”\\n\\nThis question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of\\nthought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its\\nforehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the\\npictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo\\nsaid, “_Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.”\\n\\n“But who is to give the prizes?” quite a chorus of voices asked.\\n\\n“Why, _she_, of course,” said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one\\nfinger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a\\nconfused way, “Prizes! Prizes!”\\n\\nAlice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her\\npocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had\\nnot got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly\\none a-piece, all round.\\n\\n“But she must have a prize herself, you know,” said the Mouse.\\n\\n“Of course,” the Dodo replied very gravely. “What else have you got in\\nyour pocket?” he went on, turning to Alice.\\n\\n“Only a thimble,” said Alice sadly.\\n\\n“Hand it over here,” said the Dodo.\\n\\nThen they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly\\npresented the thimble, saying “We beg your acceptance of this elegant\\nthimble;” and, when it had finished this short speech, they all\\ncheered.\\n\\nAlice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave\\nthat she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything\\nto say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as\\nshe could.\\n\\nThe next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and\\nconfusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste\\ntheirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.\\nHowever, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and\\nbegged the Mouse to tell them something more.\\n\\n“You promised to tell me your history, you know,” said Alice, “and why\\nit is you hate—C and D,” she added in a whisper, half afraid that it\\nwould be offended again.\\n\\n“Mine is a long and a sad tale!” said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and\\nsighing.\\n\\n“It _is_ a long tail, certainly,” said Alice, looking down with wonder\\nat the Mouse’s tail; “but why do you call it sad?” And she kept on\\npuzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the\\ntale was something like this:—\\n\\n         “Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, ‘Let us both\\n         go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.—Come, I’ll take no\\n         denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I’ve\\n         nothing to do.’ Said the mouse to the cur, ‘Such a trial, dear\\n         sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.’\\n         ‘I’ll be judge, I’ll be jury,’ Said cunning old Fury: ‘I’ll\\n         try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.’”\\n\\n“You are not attending!” said the Mouse to Alice severely. “What are\\nyou thinking of?”\\n\\n“I beg your pardon,” said Alice very humbly: “you had got to the fifth\\nbend, I think?”\\n\\n“I had _not!_” cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.\\n\\n“A knot!” said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking\\nanxiously about her. “Oh, do let me help to undo it!”\\n\\n“I shall do nothing of the sort,” said the Mouse, getting up and\\nwalking away. “You insult me by talking such nonsense!”\\n\\n“I didn’t mean it!” pleaded poor Alice. “But you’re so easily offended,\\nyou know!”\\n\\nThe Mouse only growled in reply.\\n\\n“Please come back and finish your story!” Alice called after it; and\\nthe others all joined in chorus, “Yes, please do!” but the Mouse only\\nshook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.\\n\\n“What a pity it wouldn’t stay!” sighed the Lory, as soon as it was\\nquite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to\\nher daughter “Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose\\n_your_ temper!” “Hold your tongue, Ma!” said the young Crab, a little\\nsnappishly. “You’re enough to try the patience of an oyster!”\\n\\n“I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!” said Alice aloud,\\naddressing nobody in particular. “She’d soon fetch it back!”\\n\\n“And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?” said the\\nLory.\\n\\nAlice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:\\n“Dinah’s our cat. And she’s such a capital one for catching mice you\\ncan’t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,\\nshe’ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!”\\n\\nThis speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the\\nbirds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very\\ncarefully, remarking, “I really must be getting home; the night-air\\ndoesn’t suit my throat!” and a Canary called out in a trembling voice\\nto its children, “Come away, my dears! It’s high time you were all in\\nbed!” On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left\\nalone.\\n\\n“I wish I hadn’t mentioned Dinah!” she said to herself in a melancholy\\ntone. “Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I’m sure she’s the best\\ncat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you\\nany more!” And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very\\nlonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a\\nlittle pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up\\neagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was\\ncoming back to finish his story.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV.\\nThe Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill\\n\\n\\nIt was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking\\nanxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard\\nit muttering to itself “The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh\\nmy fur and whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are\\nferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?” Alice guessed in a\\nmoment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid\\ngloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but\\nthey were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since\\nher swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the\\nlittle door, had vanished completely.\\n\\nVery soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and\\ncalled out to her in an angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you\\ndoing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and\\na fan! Quick, now!” And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off\\nat once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the\\nmistake it had made.\\n\\n“He took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran. “How\\nsurprised he’ll be when he finds out who I am! But I’d better take him\\nhis fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them.” As she said this, she\\ncame upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass\\nplate with the name “W. RABBIT,” engraved upon it. She went in without\\nknocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the\\nreal Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the\\nfan and gloves.\\n\\n“How queer it seems,” Alice said to herself, “to be going messages for\\na rabbit! I suppose Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next!” And she\\nbegan fancying the sort of thing that would happen: “‘Miss Alice! Come\\nhere directly, and get ready for your walk!’ ‘Coming in a minute,\\nnurse! But I’ve got to see that the mouse doesn’t get out.’ Only I\\ndon’t think,” Alice went on, “that they’d let Dinah stop in the house\\nif it began ordering people about like that!”\\n\\nBy this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table\\nin the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three\\npairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the\\ngloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a\\nlittle bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label\\nthis time with the words “DRINK ME,” but nevertheless she uncorked it\\nand put it to her lips. “I know _something_ interesting is sure to\\nhappen,” she said to herself, “whenever I eat or drink anything; so\\nI’ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it’ll make me grow large\\nagain, for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!”\\n\\nIt did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had\\ndrunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,\\nand had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put\\ndown the bottle, saying to herself “That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t\\ngrow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I do wish I hadn’t\\ndrunk quite so much!”\\n\\nAlas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,\\nand very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there\\nwas not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with\\none elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.\\nStill she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out\\nof the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself “Now I\\ncan do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?”\\n\\nLuckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,\\nand she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there\\nseemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room\\nagain, no wonder she felt unhappy.\\n\\n“It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor Alice, “when one wasn’t\\nalways growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and\\nrabbits. I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and\\nyet—it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what\\n_can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied\\nthat kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of\\none! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And\\nwhen I grow up, I’ll write one—but I’m grown up now,” she added in a\\nsorrowful tone; “at least there’s no room to grow up any more _here_.”\\n\\n“But then,” thought Alice, “shall I _never_ get any older than I am\\nnow? That’ll be a comfort, one way—never to be an old woman—but\\nthen—always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn’t like _that!_”\\n\\n“Oh, you foolish Alice!” she answered herself. “How can you learn\\nlessons in here? Why, there’s hardly room for _you_, and no room at all\\nfor any lesson-books!”\\n\\nAnd so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and\\nmaking quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes\\nshe heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\\n\\n“Mary Ann! Mary Ann!” said the voice. “Fetch me my gloves this moment!”\\nThen came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was\\nthe Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the\\nhouse, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as\\nlarge as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\\n\\nPresently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as\\nthe door opened inwards, and Alice’s elbow was pressed hard against it,\\nthat attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself “Then I’ll\\ngo round and get in at the window.”\\n\\n“_That_ you won’t!” thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied\\nshe heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\\nhand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,\\nbut she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\\nfrom which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\\ncucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\\n\\nNext came an angry voice—the Rabbit’s—“Pat! Pat! Where are you?” And\\nthen a voice she had never heard before, “Sure then I’m here! Digging\\nfor apples, yer honour!”\\n\\n“Digging for apples, indeed!” said the Rabbit angrily. “Here! Come and\\nhelp me out of _this!_” (Sounds of more broken glass.)\\n\\n“Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?”\\n\\n“Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!” (He pronounced it “arrum.”)\\n\\n“An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole\\nwindow!”\\n\\n“Sure, it does, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all that.”\\n\\n“Well, it’s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!”\\n\\nThere was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers\\nnow and then; such as, “Sure, I don’t like it, yer honour, at all, at\\nall!” “Do as I tell you, you coward!” and at last she spread out her\\nhand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were\\n_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. “What a number\\nof cucumber-frames there must be!” thought Alice. “I wonder what\\nthey’ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they\\n_could!_ I’m sure _I_ don’t want to stay in here any longer!”\\n\\nShe waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a\\nrumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all\\ntalking together: she made out the words: “Where’s the other\\nladder?—Why, I hadn’t to bring but one; Bill’s got the other—Bill!\\nfetch it here, lad!—Here, put ’em up at this corner—No, tie ’em\\ntogether first—they don’t reach half high enough yet—Oh! they’ll do\\nwell enough; don’t be particular—Here, Bill! catch hold of this\\nrope—Will the roof bear?—Mind that loose slate—Oh, it’s coming down!\\nHeads below!” (a loud crash)—“Now, who did that?—It was Bill, I\\nfancy—Who’s to go down the chimney?—Nay, _I_ shan’t! _You_ do\\nit!—_That_ I won’t, then!—Bill’s to go down—Here, Bill! the master says\\nyou’re to go down the chimney!”\\n\\n“Oh! So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?” said Alice to\\nherself. “Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn’t be in\\nBill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but\\nI _think_ I can kick a little!”\\n\\nShe drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till\\nshe heard a little animal (she couldn’t guess of what sort it was)\\nscratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,\\nsaying to herself “This is Bill,” she gave one sharp kick, and waited\\nto see what would happen next.\\n\\nThe first thing she heard was a general chorus of “There goes Bill!”\\nthen the Rabbit’s voice along—“Catch him, you by the hedge!” then\\nsilence, and then another confusion of voices—“Hold up his head—Brandy\\nnow—Don’t choke him—How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell\\nus all about it!”\\n\\nLast came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (“That’s Bill,” thought\\nAlice,) “Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I’m better now—but I’m\\na deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is, something comes at me\\nlike a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!”\\n\\n“So you did, old fellow!” said the others.\\n\\n“We must burn the house down!” said the Rabbit’s voice; and Alice\\ncalled out as loud as she could, “If you do, I’ll set Dinah at you!”\\n\\nThere was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, “I\\nwonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, they’d take the\\nroof off.” After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and\\nAlice heard the Rabbit say, “A barrowful will do, to begin with.”\\n\\n“A barrowful of _what?_” thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,\\nfor the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\\nwindow, and some of them hit her in the face. “I’ll put a stop to\\nthis,” she said to herself, and shouted out, “You’d better not do that\\nagain!” which produced another dead silence.\\n\\nAlice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into\\nlittle cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her\\nhead. “If I eat one of these cakes,” she thought, “it’s sure to make\\n_some_ change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it\\nmust make me smaller, I suppose.”\\n\\nSo she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\\nbegan shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get\\nthrough the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of\\nlittle animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill,\\nwas in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\\nsomething out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\\nappeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\\nsafe in a thick wood.\\n\\n“The first thing I’ve got to do,” said Alice to herself, as she\\nwandered about in the wood, “is to grow to my right size again; and the\\nsecond thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that\\nwill be the best plan.”\\n\\nIt sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\\narranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea\\nhow to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among\\nthe trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\\ngreat hurry.\\n\\nAn enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\\nfeebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. “Poor little\\nthing!” said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to\\nit; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it\\nmight be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in\\nspite of all her coaxing.\\n\\nHardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\\nheld it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\\nall its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\\nand made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,\\nto keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\\nother side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\\nover heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was\\nvery like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\\nmoment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\\nthe puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\\nlittle way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\\nall the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\\nits tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\\n\\nThis seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she\\nset off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,\\nand till the puppy’s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\\n\\n“And yet what a dear little puppy it was!” said Alice, as she leant\\nagainst a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the\\nleaves: “I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if I’d\\nonly been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I’d nearly forgotten that\\nI’ve got to grow up again! Let me see—how _is_ it to be managed? I\\nsuppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great\\nquestion is, what?”\\n\\nThe great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at\\nthe flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that\\nlooked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.\\nThere was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as\\nherself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and\\nbehind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what\\nwas on the top of it.\\n\\nShe stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the\\nmushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue\\ncaterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly\\nsmoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of\\nanything else.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V.\\nAdvice from a Caterpillar\\n\\n\\nThe Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in\\nsilence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and\\naddressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.\\n\\n“Who are _you?_” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\nThis was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,\\nrather shyly, “I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know\\nwho I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been\\nchanged several times since then.”\\n\\n“What do you mean by that?” said the Caterpillar sternly. “Explain\\nyourself!”\\n\\n“I can’t explain _myself_, I’m afraid, sir,” said Alice, “because I’m\\nnot myself, you see.”\\n\\n“I don’t see,” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n“I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,” Alice replied very politely,\\n“for I can’t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many\\ndifferent sizes in a day is very confusing.”\\n\\n“It isn’t,” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n“Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,” said Alice; “but when you\\nhave to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—and then\\nafter that into a butterfly, I should think you’ll feel it a little\\nqueer, won’t you?”\\n\\n“Not a bit,” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n“Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,” said Alice; “all I know\\nis, it would feel very queer to _me_.”\\n\\n“You!” said the Caterpillar contemptuously. “Who are _you?_”\\n\\nWhich brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.\\nAlice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar’s making such _very_\\nshort remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, “I\\nthink, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.”\\n\\n“Why?” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\nHere was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any\\ngood reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant\\nstate of mind, she turned away.\\n\\n“Come back!” the Caterpillar called after her. “I’ve something\\nimportant to say!”\\n\\nThis sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.\\n\\n“Keep your temper,” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n“Is that all?” said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she\\ncould.\\n\\n“No,” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\nAlice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,\\nand perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For\\nsome minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded\\nits arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, “So you\\nthink you’re changed, do you?”\\n\\n“I’m afraid I am, sir,” said Alice; “I can’t remember things as I\\nused—and I don’t keep the same size for ten minutes together!”\\n\\n“Can’t remember _what_ things?” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n“Well, I’ve tried to say “How doth the little busy bee,” but it all\\ncame different!” Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.\\n\\n“Repeat, “_You are old, Father William_,’” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\nAlice folded her hands, and began:—\\n\\n“You are old, Father William,” the young man said,\\n    “And your hair has become very white;\\nAnd yet you incessantly stand on your head—\\n    Do you think, at your age, it is right?”\\n\\n“In my youth,” Father William replied to his son,\\n    “I feared it might injure the brain;\\nBut, now that I’m perfectly sure I have none,\\n    Why, I do it again and again.”\\n\\n“You are old,” said the youth, “as I mentioned before,\\n    And have grown most uncommonly fat;\\nYet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—\\n    Pray, what is the reason of that?”\\n\\n“In my youth,” said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\\n    “I kept all my limbs very supple\\nBy the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—\\n    Allow me to sell you a couple?”\\n\\n“You are old,” said the youth, “and your jaws are too weak\\n    For anything tougher than suet;\\nYet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak—\\n    Pray, how did you manage to do it?”\\n\\n“In my youth,” said his father, “I took to the law,\\n    And argued each case with my wife;\\nAnd the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\\n    Has lasted the rest of my life.”\\n\\n“You are old,” said the youth, “one would hardly suppose\\n    That your eye was as steady as ever;\\nYet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—\\n    What made you so awfully clever?”\\n\\n“I have answered three questions, and that is enough,”\\n    Said his father; “don’t give yourself airs!\\nDo you think I can listen all day to such stuff?\\n    Be off, or I’ll kick you down stairs!”\\n\\n\\n“That is not said right,” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n“Not _quite_ right, I’m afraid,” said Alice, timidly; “some of the\\nwords have got altered.”\\n\\n“It is wrong from beginning to end,” said the Caterpillar decidedly,\\nand there was silence for some minutes.\\n\\nThe Caterpillar was the first to speak.\\n\\n“What size do you want to be?” it asked.\\n\\n“Oh, I’m not particular as to size,” Alice hastily replied; “only one\\ndoesn’t like changing so often, you know.”\\n\\n“I _don’t_ know,” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\nAlice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life\\nbefore, and she felt that she was losing her temper.\\n\\n“Are you content now?” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n“Well, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldn’t\\nmind,” said Alice: “three inches is such a wretched height to be.”\\n\\n“It is a very good height indeed!” said the Caterpillar angrily,\\nrearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).\\n\\n“But I’m not used to it!” pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she\\nthought of herself, “I wish the creatures wouldn’t be so easily\\noffended!”\\n\\n“You’ll get used to it in time,” said the Caterpillar; and it put the\\nhookah into its mouth and began smoking again.\\n\\nThis time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a\\nminute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and\\nyawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the\\nmushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,\\n“One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you\\ngrow shorter.”\\n\\n“One side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_” thought Alice to\\nherself.\\n\\n“Of the mushroom,” said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it\\naloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.\\n\\nAlice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,\\ntrying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was\\nperfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at\\nlast she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke\\noff a bit of the edge with each hand.\\n\\n“And now which is which?” she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\\nthe right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a\\nviolent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!\\n\\nShe was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt\\nthat there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she\\nset to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed\\nso closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her\\nmouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the\\nlefthand bit.\\n\\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n\\n“Come, my head’s free at last!” said Alice in a tone of delight, which\\nchanged into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders\\nwere nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was\\nan immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a\\nsea of green leaves that lay far below her.\\n\\n“What _can_ all that green stuff be?” said Alice. “And where _have_ my\\nshoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can’t see you?”\\nShe was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,\\nexcept a little shaking among the distant green leaves.\\n\\nAs there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,\\nshe tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that\\nher neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She\\nhad just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was\\ngoing to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but\\nthe tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp\\nhiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her\\nface, and was beating her violently with its wings.\\n\\n“Serpent!” screamed the Pigeon.\\n\\n“I’m _not_ a serpent!” said Alice indignantly. “Let me alone!”\\n\\n“Serpent, I say again!” repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued\\ntone, and added with a kind of sob, “I’ve tried every way, and nothing\\nseems to suit them!”\\n\\n“I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking about,” said Alice.\\n\\n“I’ve tried the roots of trees, and I’ve tried banks, and I’ve tried\\nhedges,” the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; “but those\\nserpents! There’s no pleasing them!”\\n\\nAlice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in\\nsaying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\\n\\n“As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the eggs,” said the Pigeon;\\n“but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I\\nhaven’t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!”\\n\\n“I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,” said Alice, who was beginning to\\nsee its meaning.\\n\\n“And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,” continued the\\nPigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, “and just as I was thinking I\\nshould be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down\\nfrom the sky! Ugh, Serpent!”\\n\\n“But I’m _not_ a serpent, I tell you!” said Alice. “I’m a—I’m a—”\\n\\n“Well! _What_ are you?” said the Pigeon. “I can see you’re trying to\\ninvent something!”\\n\\n“I—I’m a little girl,” said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered\\nthe number of changes she had gone through that day.\\n\\n“A likely story indeed!” said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest\\ncontempt. “I’ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never\\n_one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! You’re a serpent; and there’s\\nno use denying it. I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never\\ntasted an egg!”\\n\\n“I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,” said Alice, who was a very truthful\\nchild; “but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you\\nknow.”\\n\\n“I don’t believe it,” said the Pigeon; “but if they do, why then\\nthey’re a kind of serpent, that’s all I can say.”\\n\\nThis was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a\\nminute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, “You’re\\nlooking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to\\nme whether you’re a little girl or a serpent?”\\n\\n“It matters a good deal to _me_,” said Alice hastily; “but I’m not\\nlooking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn’t want\\n_yours_: I don’t like them raw.”\\n\\n“Well, be off, then!” said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\\ndown again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well\\nas she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,\\nand every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while\\nshe remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,\\nand she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at\\nthe other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until\\nshe had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\\n\\nIt was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it\\nfelt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,\\nand began talking to herself, as usual. “Come, there’s half my plan\\ndone now! How puzzling all these changes are! I’m never sure what I’m\\ngoing to be, from one minute to another! However, I’ve got back to my\\nright size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how\\n_is_ that to be done, I wonder?” As she said this, she came suddenly\\nupon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.\\n“Whoever lives there,” thought Alice, “it’ll never do to come upon them\\n_this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!” So she\\nbegan nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go\\nnear the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI.\\nPig and Pepper\\n\\n\\nFor a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what\\nto do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the\\nwood—(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:\\notherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a\\nfish)—and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by\\nanother footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a\\nfrog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled\\nall over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all\\nabout, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.\\n\\nThe Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\\nnearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,\\nsaying, in a solemn tone, “For the Duchess. An invitation from the\\nQueen to play croquet.” The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn\\ntone, only changing the order of the words a little, “From the Queen.\\nAn invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.”\\n\\nThen they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.\\n\\nAlice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood\\nfor fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the\\nFish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the\\ndoor, staring stupidly up into the sky.\\n\\nAlice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\\n\\n“There’s no sort of use in knocking,” said the Footman, “and that for\\ntwo reasons. First, because I’m on the same side of the door as you\\nare; secondly, because they’re making such a noise inside, no one could\\npossibly hear you.” And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary\\nnoise going on within—a constant howling and sneezing, and every now\\nand then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to\\npieces.\\n\\n“Please, then,” said Alice, “how am I to get in?”\\n\\n“There might be some sense in your knocking,” the Footman went on\\nwithout attending to her, “if we had the door between us. For instance,\\nif you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you\\nknow.” He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and\\nthis Alice thought decidedly uncivil. “But perhaps he can’t help it,”\\nshe said to herself; “his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his\\nhead. But at any rate he might answer questions.—How am I to get in?”\\nshe repeated, aloud.\\n\\n“I shall sit here,” the Footman remarked, “till tomorrow—”\\n\\nAt this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came\\nskimming out, straight at the Footman’s head: it just grazed his nose,\\nand broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.\\n\\n“—or next day, maybe,” the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly\\nas if nothing had happened.\\n\\n“How am I to get in?” asked Alice again, in a louder tone.\\n\\n“_Are_ you to get in at all?” said the Footman. “That’s the first\\nquestion, you know.”\\n\\nIt was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. “It’s really\\ndreadful,” she muttered to herself, “the way all the creatures argue.\\nIt’s enough to drive one crazy!”\\n\\nThe Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his\\nremark, with variations. “I shall sit here,” he said, “on and off, for\\ndays and days.”\\n\\n“But what am _I_ to do?” said Alice.\\n\\n“Anything you like,” said the Footman, and began whistling.\\n\\n“Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,” said Alice desperately: “he’s\\nperfectly idiotic!” And she opened the door and went in.\\n\\nThe door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from\\none end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool\\nin the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire,\\nstirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.\\n\\n“There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!” Alice said to\\nherself, as well as she could for sneezing.\\n\\nThere was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed\\noccasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\\nalternately without a moment’s pause. The only things in the kitchen\\nthat did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting\\non the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.\\n\\n“Please would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, for she was\\nnot quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, “why\\nyour cat grins like that?”\\n\\n“It’s a Cheshire cat,” said the Duchess, “and that’s why. Pig!”\\n\\nShe said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite\\njumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the\\nbaby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:—\\n\\n“I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t\\nknow that cats _could_ grin.”\\n\\n“They all can,” said the Duchess; “and most of ’em do.”\\n\\n“I don’t know of any that do,” Alice said very politely, feeling quite\\npleased to have got into a conversation.\\n\\n“You don’t know much,” said the Duchess; “and that’s a fact.”\\n\\nAlice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would\\nbe as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she\\nwas trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the\\nfire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at\\nthe Duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first; then followed a\\nshower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of\\nthem even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,\\nthat it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\\n\\n“Oh, _please_ mind what you’re doing!” cried Alice, jumping up and down\\nin an agony of terror. “Oh, there goes his _precious_ nose!” as an\\nunusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it\\noff.\\n\\n“If everybody minded their own business,” the Duchess said in a hoarse\\ngrowl, “the world would go round a deal faster than it does.”\\n\\n“Which would _not_ be an advantage,” said Alice, who felt very glad to\\nget an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. “Just\\nthink of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the\\nearth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis—”\\n\\n“Talking of axes,” said the Duchess, “chop off her head!”\\n\\nAlice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take\\nthe hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to\\nbe listening, so she went on again: “Twenty-four hours, I _think_; or\\nis it twelve? I—”\\n\\n“Oh, don’t bother _me_,” said the Duchess; “I never could abide\\nfigures!” And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a\\nsort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at\\nthe end of every line:\\n\\n“Speak roughly to your little boy,\\n    And beat him when he sneezes:\\nHe only does it to annoy,\\n    Because he knows it teases.”\\n\\n\\nCHORUS.\\n(In which the cook and the baby joined):\\n\\n\\n“Wow! wow! wow!”\\n\\n\\nWhile the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing\\nthe baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,\\nthat Alice could hardly hear the words:—\\n\\n“I speak severely to my boy,\\n    I beat him when he sneezes;\\nFor he can thoroughly enjoy\\n    The pepper when he pleases!”\\n\\n\\nCHORUS.\\n\\n\\n“Wow! wow! wow!”\\n\\n\\n“Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!” the Duchess said to Alice,\\nflinging the baby at her as she spoke. “I must go and get ready to play\\ncroquet with the Queen,” and she hurried out of the room. The cook\\nthrew a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.\\n\\nAlice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped\\nlittle creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,\\n“just like a star-fish,” thought Alice. The poor little thing was\\nsnorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling\\nitself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for\\nthe first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.\\n\\nAs soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to\\ntwist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right\\near and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it\\nout into the open air. “If I don’t take this child away with me,”\\nthought Alice, “they’re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn’t it be\\nmurder to leave it behind?” She said the last words out loud, and the\\nlittle thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).\\n“Don’t grunt,” said Alice; “that’s not at all a proper way of\\nexpressing yourself.”\\n\\nThe baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face\\nto see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had\\na _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also\\nits eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did\\nnot like the look of the thing at all. “But perhaps it was only\\nsobbing,” she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there\\nwere any tears.\\n\\nNo, there were no tears. “If you’re going to turn into a pig, my dear,”\\nsaid Alice, seriously, “I’ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind\\nnow!” The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible\\nto say which), and they went on for some while in silence.\\n\\nAlice was just beginning to think to herself, “Now, what am I to do\\nwith this creature when I get it home?” when it grunted again, so\\nviolently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time\\nthere could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than\\na pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it\\nfurther.\\n\\nSo she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it\\ntrot away quietly into the wood. “If it had grown up,” she said to\\nherself, “it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes\\nrather a handsome pig, I think.” And she began thinking over other\\nchildren she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying\\nto herself, “if one only knew the right way to change them—” when she\\nwas a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of\\na tree a few yards off.\\n\\nThe Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she\\nthought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she\\nfelt that it ought to be treated with respect.\\n\\n“Cheshire Puss,” she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know\\nwhether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little\\nwider. “Come, it’s pleased so far,” thought Alice, and she went on.\\n“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”\\n\\n“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.\\n\\n“I don’t much care where—” said Alice.\\n\\n“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.\\n\\n“—so long as I get _somewhere_,” Alice added as an explanation.\\n\\n“Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long\\nenough.”\\n\\nAlice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another\\nquestion. “What sort of people live about here?”\\n\\n“In _that_ direction,” the Cat said, waving its right paw round, “lives\\na Hatter: and in _that_ direction,” waving the other paw, “lives a\\nMarch Hare. Visit either you like: they’re both mad.”\\n\\n“But I don’t want to go among mad people,” Alice remarked.\\n\\n“Oh, you can’t help that,” said the Cat: “we’re all mad here. I’m mad.\\nYou’re mad.”\\n\\n“How do you know I’m mad?” said Alice.\\n\\n“You must be,” said the Cat, “or you wouldn’t have come here.”\\n\\nAlice didn’t think that proved it at all; however, she went on “And how\\ndo you know that you’re mad?”\\n\\n“To begin with,” said the Cat, “a dog’s not mad. You grant that?”\\n\\n“I suppose so,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Well, then,” the Cat went on, “you see, a dog growls when it’s angry,\\nand wags its tail when it’s pleased. Now _I_ growl when I’m pleased,\\nand wag my tail when I’m angry. Therefore I’m mad.”\\n\\n“_I_ call it purring, not growling,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Call it what you like,” said the Cat. “Do you play croquet with the\\nQueen to-day?”\\n\\n“I should like it very much,” said Alice, “but I haven’t been invited\\nyet.”\\n\\n“You’ll see me there,” said the Cat, and vanished.\\n\\nAlice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer\\nthings happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,\\nit suddenly appeared again.\\n\\n“By-the-bye, what became of the baby?” said the Cat. “I’d nearly\\nforgotten to ask.”\\n\\n“It turned into a pig,” Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back\\nin a natural way.\\n\\n“I thought it would,” said the Cat, and vanished again.\\n\\nAlice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not\\nappear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in\\nwhich the March Hare was said to live. “I’ve seen hatters before,” she\\nsaid to herself; “the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and\\nperhaps as this is May it won’t be raving mad—at least not so mad as it\\nwas in March.” As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat\\nagain, sitting on a branch of a tree.\\n\\n“Did you say pig, or fig?” said the Cat.\\n\\n“I said pig,” replied Alice; “and I wish you wouldn’t keep appearing\\nand vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.”\\n\\n“All right,” said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,\\nbeginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which\\nremained some time after the rest of it had gone.\\n\\n“Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,” thought Alice; “but a\\ngrin without a cat! It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!”\\n\\nShe had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of\\nthe March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the\\nchimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It\\nwas so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had\\nnibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself\\nto about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather\\ntimidly, saying to herself “Suppose it should be raving mad after all!\\nI almost wish I’d gone to see the Hatter instead!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII.\\nA Mad Tea-Party\\n\\n\\nThere was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the\\nMarch Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting\\nbetween them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a\\ncushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. “Very\\nuncomfortable for the Dormouse,” thought Alice; “only, as it’s asleep,\\nI suppose it doesn’t mind.”\\n\\nThe table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at\\none corner of it: “No room! No room!” they cried out when they saw\\nAlice coming. “There’s _plenty_ of room!” said Alice indignantly, and\\nshe sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.\\n\\n“Have some wine,” the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.\\n\\nAlice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.\\n“I don’t see any wine,” she remarked.\\n\\n“There isn’t any,” said the March Hare.\\n\\n“Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,” said Alice angrily.\\n\\n“It wasn’t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,” said\\nthe March Hare.\\n\\n“I didn’t know it was _your_ table,” said Alice; “it’s laid for a great\\nmany more than three.”\\n\\n“Your hair wants cutting,” said the Hatter. He had been looking at\\nAlice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first\\nspeech.\\n\\n“You should learn not to make personal remarks,” Alice said with some\\nseverity; “it’s very rude.”\\n\\nThe Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_\\nwas, “Why is a raven like a writing-desk?”\\n\\n“Come, we shall have some fun now!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they’ve\\nbegun asking riddles.—I believe I can guess that,” she added aloud.\\n\\n“Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?” said\\nthe March Hare.\\n\\n“Exactly so,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Then you should say what you mean,” the March Hare went on.\\n\\n“I do,” Alice hastily replied; “at least—at least I mean what I\\nsay—that’s the same thing, you know.”\\n\\n“Not the same thing a bit!” said the Hatter. “You might just as well\\nsay that ‘I see what I eat’ is the same thing as ‘I eat what I see’!”\\n\\n“You might just as well say,” added the March Hare, “that ‘I like what\\nI get’ is the same thing as ‘I get what I like’!”\\n\\n“You might just as well say,” added the Dormouse, who seemed to be\\ntalking in his sleep, “that ‘I breathe when I sleep’ is the same thing\\nas ‘I sleep when I breathe’!”\\n\\n“It _is_ the same thing with you,” said the Hatter, and here the\\nconversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while\\nAlice thought over all she could remember about ravens and\\nwriting-desks, which wasn’t much.\\n\\nThe Hatter was the first to break the silence. “What day of the month\\nis it?” he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his\\npocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,\\nand holding it to his ear.\\n\\nAlice considered a little, and then said “The fourth.”\\n\\n“Two days wrong!” sighed the Hatter. “I told you butter wouldn’t suit\\nthe works!” he added looking angrily at the March Hare.\\n\\n“It was the _best_ butter,” the March Hare meekly replied.\\n\\n“Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,” the Hatter grumbled:\\n“you shouldn’t have put it in with the bread-knife.”\\n\\nThe March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped\\nit into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of\\nnothing better to say than his first remark, “It was the _best_ butter,\\nyou know.”\\n\\nAlice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. “What a\\nfunny watch!” she remarked. “It tells the day of the month, and doesn’t\\ntell what o’clock it is!”\\n\\n“Why should it?” muttered the Hatter. “Does _your_ watch tell you what\\nyear it is?”\\n\\n“Of course not,” Alice replied very readily: “but that’s because it\\nstays the same year for such a long time together.”\\n\\n“Which is just the case with _mine_,” said the Hatter.\\n\\nAlice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter’s remark seemed to have no\\nsort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. “I don’t quite\\nunderstand you,” she said, as politely as she could.\\n\\n“The Dormouse is asleep again,” said the Hatter, and he poured a little\\nhot tea upon its nose.\\n\\nThe Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its\\neyes, “Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.”\\n\\n“Have you guessed the riddle yet?” the Hatter said, turning to Alice\\nagain.\\n\\n“No, I give it up,” Alice replied: “what’s the answer?”\\n\\n“I haven’t the slightest idea,” said the Hatter.\\n\\n“Nor I,” said the March Hare.\\n\\nAlice sighed wearily. “I think you might do something better with the\\ntime,” she said, “than waste it in asking riddles that have no\\nanswers.”\\n\\n“If you knew Time as well as I do,” said the Hatter, “you wouldn’t talk\\nabout wasting _it_. It’s _him_.”\\n\\n“I don’t know what you mean,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Of course you don’t!” the Hatter said, tossing his head\\ncontemptuously. “I dare say you never even spoke to Time!”\\n\\n“Perhaps not,” Alice cautiously replied: “but I know I have to beat\\ntime when I learn music.”\\n\\n“Ah! that accounts for it,” said the Hatter. “He won’t stand beating.\\nNow, if you only kept on good terms with him, he’d do almost anything\\nyou liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o’clock in\\nthe morning, just time to begin lessons: you’d only have to whisper a\\nhint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,\\ntime for dinner!”\\n\\n(“I only wish it was,” the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)\\n\\n“That would be grand, certainly,” said Alice thoughtfully: “but then—I\\nshouldn’t be hungry for it, you know.”\\n\\n“Not at first, perhaps,” said the Hatter: “but you could keep it to\\nhalf-past one as long as you liked.”\\n\\n“Is that the way _you_ manage?” Alice asked.\\n\\nThe Hatter shook his head mournfully. “Not I!” he replied. “We\\nquarrelled last March—just before _he_ went mad, you know—” (pointing\\nwith his tea spoon at the March Hare,) “—it was at the great concert\\ngiven by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\\n\\n‘Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!\\nHow I wonder what you’re at!’\\n\\n\\nYou know the song, perhaps?”\\n\\n“I’ve heard something like it,” said Alice.\\n\\n“It goes on, you know,” the Hatter continued, “in this way:—\\n\\n‘Up above the world you fly,\\nLike a tea-tray in the sky.\\n                    Twinkle, twinkle—’”\\n\\n\\nHere the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep\\n“_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_—” and went on so long that they\\nhad to pinch it to make it stop.\\n\\n“Well, I’d hardly finished the first verse,” said the Hatter, “when the\\nQueen jumped up and bawled out, ‘He’s murdering the time! Off with his\\nhead!’”\\n\\n“How dreadfully savage!” exclaimed Alice.\\n\\n“And ever since that,” the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, “he won’t\\ndo a thing I ask! It’s always six o’clock now.”\\n\\nA bright idea came into Alice’s head. “Is that the reason so many\\ntea-things are put out here?” she asked.\\n\\n“Yes, that’s it,” said the Hatter with a sigh: “it’s always tea-time,\\nand we’ve no time to wash the things between whiles.”\\n\\n“Then you keep moving round, I suppose?” said Alice.\\n\\n“Exactly so,” said the Hatter: “as the things get used up.”\\n\\n“But what happens when you come to the beginning again?” Alice ventured\\nto ask.\\n\\n“Suppose we change the subject,” the March Hare interrupted, yawning.\\n“I’m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.”\\n\\n“I’m afraid I don’t know one,” said Alice, rather alarmed at the\\nproposal.\\n\\n“Then the Dormouse shall!” they both cried. “Wake up, Dormouse!” And\\nthey pinched it on both sides at once.\\n\\nThe Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. “I wasn’t asleep,” he said in a\\nhoarse, feeble voice: “I heard every word you fellows were saying.”\\n\\n“Tell us a story!” said the March Hare.\\n\\n“Yes, please do!” pleaded Alice.\\n\\n“And be quick about it,” added the Hatter, “or you’ll be asleep again\\nbefore it’s done.”\\n\\n“Once upon a time there were three little sisters,” the Dormouse began\\nin a great hurry; “and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and\\nthey lived at the bottom of a well—”\\n\\n“What did they live on?” said Alice, who always took a great interest\\nin questions of eating and drinking.\\n\\n“They lived on treacle,” said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or\\ntwo.\\n\\n“They couldn’t have done that, you know,” Alice gently remarked;\\n“they’d have been ill.”\\n\\n“So they were,” said the Dormouse; “_very_ ill.”\\n\\nAlice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of\\nliving would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: “But\\nwhy did they live at the bottom of a well?”\\n\\n“Take some more tea,” the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.\\n\\n“I’ve had nothing yet,” Alice replied in an offended tone, “so I can’t\\ntake more.”\\n\\n“You mean you can’t take _less_,” said the Hatter: “it’s very easy to\\ntake _more_ than nothing.”\\n\\n“Nobody asked _your_ opinion,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Who’s making personal remarks now?” the Hatter asked triumphantly.\\n\\nAlice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to\\nsome tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and\\nrepeated her question. “Why did they live at the bottom of a well?”\\n\\nThe Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then\\nsaid, “It was a treacle-well.”\\n\\n“There’s no such thing!” Alice was beginning very angrily, but the\\nHatter and the March Hare went “Sh! sh!” and the Dormouse sulkily\\nremarked, “If you can’t be civil, you’d better finish the story for\\nyourself.”\\n\\n“No, please go on!” Alice said very humbly; “I won’t interrupt again. I\\ndare say there may be _one_.”\\n\\n“One, indeed!” said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to\\ngo on. “And so these three little sisters—they were learning to draw,\\nyou know—”\\n\\n“What did they draw?” said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.\\n\\n“Treacle,” said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.\\n\\n“I want a clean cup,” interrupted the Hatter: “let’s all move one place\\non.”\\n\\nHe moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare\\nmoved into the Dormouse’s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the\\nplace of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any\\nadvantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than\\nbefore, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.\\n\\nAlice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very\\ncautiously: “But I don’t understand. Where did they draw the treacle\\nfrom?”\\n\\n“You can draw water out of a water-well,” said the Hatter; “so I should\\nthink you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well—eh, stupid?”\\n\\n“But they were _in_ the well,” Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing\\nto notice this last remark.\\n\\n“Of course they were,” said the Dormouse; “—well in.”\\n\\nThis answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for\\nsome time without interrupting it.\\n\\n“They were learning to draw,” the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing\\nits eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; “and they drew all manner of\\nthings—everything that begins with an M—”\\n\\n“Why with an M?” said Alice.\\n\\n“Why not?” said the March Hare.\\n\\nAlice was silent.\\n\\nThe Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a\\ndoze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a\\nlittle shriek, and went on: “—that begins with an M, such as\\nmouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness—you know you say\\nthings are “much of a muchness”—did you ever see such a thing as a\\ndrawing of a muchness?”\\n\\n“Really, now you ask me,” said Alice, very much confused, “I don’t\\nthink—”\\n\\n“Then you shouldn’t talk,” said the Hatter.\\n\\nThis piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in\\ngreat disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and\\nneither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she\\nlooked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:\\nthe last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into\\nthe teapot.\\n\\n“At any rate I’ll never go _there_ again!” said Alice as she picked her\\nway through the wood. “It’s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in\\nall my life!”\\n\\nJust as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door\\nleading right into it. “That’s very curious!” she thought. “But\\neverything’s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.” And\\nin she went.\\n\\nOnce more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little\\nglass table. “Now, I’ll manage better this time,” she said to herself,\\nand began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that\\nled into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom\\n(she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot\\nhigh: then she walked down the little passage: and _then_—she found\\nherself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds\\nand the cool fountains.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\nThe Queen’s Croquet-Ground\\n\\n\\nA large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses\\ngrowing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily\\npainting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she\\nwent nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard\\none of them say, “Look out now, Five! Don’t go splashing paint over me\\nlike that!”\\n\\n“I couldn’t help it,” said Five, in a sulky tone; “Seven jogged my\\nelbow.”\\n\\nOn which Seven looked up and said, “That’s right, Five! Always lay the\\nblame on others!”\\n\\n“_You’d_ better not talk!” said Five. “I heard the Queen say only\\nyesterday you deserved to be beheaded!”\\n\\n“What for?” said the one who had spoken first.\\n\\n“That’s none of _your_ business, Two!” said Seven.\\n\\n“Yes, it _is_ his business!” said Five, “and I’ll tell him—it was for\\nbringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.”\\n\\nSeven flung down his brush, and had just begun “Well, of all the unjust\\nthings—” when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching\\nthem, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also,\\nand all of them bowed low.\\n\\n“Would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, “why you are\\npainting those roses?”\\n\\nFive and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low\\nvoice, “Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a\\n_red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen\\nwas to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So\\nyou see, Miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes, to—” At this\\nmoment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called\\nout “The Queen! The Queen!” and the three gardeners instantly threw\\nthemselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,\\nand Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.\\n\\nFirst came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the\\nthree gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the\\ncorners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with\\ndiamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came\\nthe royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came\\njumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all\\nornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,\\nand among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a\\nhurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went\\nby without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying\\nthe King’s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this\\ngrand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\\n\\nAlice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face\\nlike the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard\\nof such a rule at processions; “and besides, what would be the use of a\\nprocession,” thought she, “if people had all to lie down upon their\\nfaces, so that they couldn’t see it?” So she stood still where she was,\\nand waited.\\n\\nWhen the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked\\nat her, and the Queen said severely “Who is this?” She said it to the\\nKnave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.\\n\\n“Idiot!” said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to\\nAlice, she went on, “What’s your name, child?”\\n\\n“My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,” said Alice very politely;\\nbut she added, to herself, “Why, they’re only a pack of cards, after\\nall. I needn’t be afraid of them!”\\n\\n“And who are _these?_” said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners\\nwho were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on\\ntheir faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of\\nthe pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers,\\nor courtiers, or three of her own children.\\n\\n“How should _I_ know?” said Alice, surprised at her own courage. “It’s\\nno business of _mine_.”\\n\\nThe Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a\\nmoment like a wild beast, screamed “Off with her head! Off—”\\n\\n“Nonsense!” said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was\\nsilent.\\n\\nThe King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said “Consider, my\\ndear: she is only a child!”\\n\\nThe Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave “Turn\\nthem over!”\\n\\nThe Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.\\n\\n“Get up!” said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three\\ngardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,\\nthe royal children, and everybody else.\\n\\n“Leave off that!” screamed the Queen. “You make me giddy.” And then,\\nturning to the rose-tree, she went on, “What _have_ you been doing\\nhere?”\\n\\n“May it please your Majesty,” said Two, in a very humble tone, going\\ndown on one knee as he spoke, “we were trying—”\\n\\n“_I_ see!” said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.\\n“Off with their heads!” and the procession moved on, three of the\\nsoldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran\\nto Alice for protection.\\n\\n“You shan’t be beheaded!” said Alice, and she put them into a large\\nflower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a\\nminute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the\\nothers.\\n\\n“Are their heads off?” shouted the Queen.\\n\\n“Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!” the soldiers shouted\\nin reply.\\n\\n“That’s right!” shouted the Queen. “Can you play croquet?”\\n\\nThe soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was\\nevidently meant for her.\\n\\n“Yes!” shouted Alice.\\n\\n“Come on, then!” roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,\\nwondering very much what would happen next.\\n\\n“It’s—it’s a very fine day!” said a timid voice at her side. She was\\nwalking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.\\n\\n“Very,” said Alice: “—where’s the Duchess?”\\n\\n“Hush! Hush!” said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked\\nanxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon\\ntiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered “She’s under\\nsentence of execution.”\\n\\n“What for?” said Alice.\\n\\n“Did you say ‘What a pity!’?” the Rabbit asked.\\n\\n“No, I didn’t,” said Alice: “I don’t think it’s at all a pity. I said\\n‘What for?’”\\n\\n“She boxed the Queen’s ears—” the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little\\nscream of laughter. “Oh, hush!” the Rabbit whispered in a frightened\\ntone. “The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the\\nQueen said—”\\n\\n“Get to your places!” shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and\\npeople began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each\\nother; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game\\nbegan. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground\\nin her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live\\nhedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double\\nthemselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\\n\\nThe chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:\\nshe succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough,\\nunder her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she\\nhad got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the\\nhedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look\\nup in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help\\nbursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was\\ngoing to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog\\nhad unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all\\nthis, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she\\nwanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were\\nalways getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice\\nsoon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.\\n\\nThe players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling\\nall the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time\\nthe Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and\\nshouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with her head!” about once in a\\nminute.\\n\\nAlice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any\\ndispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,\\n“and then,” thought she, “what would become of me? They’re dreadfully\\nfond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there’s any\\none left alive!”\\n\\nShe was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she\\ncould get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious\\nappearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after\\nwatching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said\\nto herself “It’s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk\\nto.”\\n\\n“How are you getting on?” said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth\\nenough for it to speak with.\\n\\nAlice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. “It’s no use\\nspeaking to it,” she thought, “till its ears have come, or at least one\\nof them.” In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put\\ndown her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad\\nshe had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there\\nwas enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.\\n\\n“I don’t think they play at all fairly,” Alice began, in rather a\\ncomplaining tone, “and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear\\noneself speak—and they don’t seem to have any rules in particular; at\\nleast, if there are, nobody attends to them—and you’ve no idea how\\nconfusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there’s the\\narch I’ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the\\nground—and I should have croqueted the Queen’s hedgehog just now, only\\nit ran away when it saw mine coming!”\\n\\n“How do you like the Queen?” said the Cat in a low voice.\\n\\n“Not at all,” said Alice: “she’s so extremely—” Just then she noticed\\nthat the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,\\n“—likely to win, that it’s hardly worth while finishing the game.”\\n\\nThe Queen smiled and passed on.\\n\\n“Who _are_ you talking to?” said the King, going up to Alice, and\\nlooking at the Cat’s head with great curiosity.\\n\\n“It’s a friend of mine—a Cheshire Cat,” said Alice: “allow me to\\nintroduce it.”\\n\\n“I don’t like the look of it at all,” said the King: “however, it may\\nkiss my hand if it likes.”\\n\\n“I’d rather not,” the Cat remarked.\\n\\n“Don’t be impertinent,” said the King, “and don’t look at me like\\nthat!” He got behind Alice as he spoke.\\n\\n“A cat may look at a king,” said Alice. “I’ve read that in some book,\\nbut I don’t remember where.”\\n\\n“Well, it must be removed,” said the King very decidedly, and he called\\nthe Queen, who was passing at the moment, “My dear! I wish you would\\nhave this cat removed!”\\n\\nThe Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or\\nsmall. “Off with his head!” she said, without even looking round.\\n\\n“I’ll fetch the executioner myself,” said the King eagerly, and he\\nhurried off.\\n\\nAlice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going\\non, as she heard the Queen’s voice in the distance, screaming with\\npassion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be\\nexecuted for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look\\nof things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew\\nwhether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.\\n\\nThe hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed\\nto Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the\\nother: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to\\nthe other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a\\nhelpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.\\n\\nBy the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight\\nwas over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: “but it doesn’t\\nmatter much,” thought Alice, “as all the arches are gone from this side\\nof the ground.” So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not\\nescape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her\\nfriend.\\n\\nWhen she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite\\na large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between\\nthe executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,\\nwhile all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.\\n\\nThe moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle\\nthe question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they\\nall spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly\\nwhat they said.\\n\\nThe executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t cut off a head unless\\nthere was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a\\nthing before, and he wasn’t going to begin at _his_ time of life.\\n\\nThe King’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be\\nbeheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense.\\n\\nThe Queen’s argument was, that if something wasn’t done about it in\\nless than no time she’d have everybody executed, all round. (It was\\nthis last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and\\nanxious.)\\n\\nAlice could think of nothing else to say but “It belongs to the\\nDuchess: you’d better ask _her_ about it.”\\n\\n“She’s in prison,” the Queen said to the executioner: “fetch her here.”\\nAnd the executioner went off like an arrow.\\n\\nThe Cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the\\ntime he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so\\nthe King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it,\\nwhile the rest of the party went back to the game.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX.\\nThe Mock Turtle’s Story\\n\\n\\n“You can’t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!”\\nsaid the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice’s,\\nand they walked off together.\\n\\nAlice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought\\nto herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so\\nsavage when they met in the kitchen.\\n\\n“When _I’m_ a Duchess,” she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful\\ntone though), “I won’t have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_. Soup\\ndoes very well without—Maybe it’s always pepper that makes people\\nhot-tempered,” she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new\\nkind of rule, “and vinegar that makes them sour—and camomile that makes\\nthem bitter—and—and barley-sugar and such things that make children\\nsweet-tempered. I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldn’t be\\nso stingy about it, you know—”\\n\\nShe had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little\\nstartled when she heard her voice close to her ear. “You’re thinking\\nabout something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can’t\\ntell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in\\na bit.”\\n\\n“Perhaps it hasn’t one,” Alice ventured to remark.\\n\\n“Tut, tut, child!” said the Duchess. “Everything’s got a moral, if only\\nyou can find it.” And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice’s side as\\nshe spoke.\\n\\nAlice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the\\nDuchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the\\nright height to rest her chin upon Alice’s shoulder, and it was an\\nuncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she\\nbore it as well as she could.\\n\\n“The game’s going on rather better now,” she said, by way of keeping up\\nthe conversation a little.\\n\\n“’Tis so,” said the Duchess: “and the moral of that is—‘Oh, ’tis love,\\n’tis love, that makes the world go round!’”\\n\\n“Somebody said,” Alice whispered, “that it’s done by everybody minding\\ntheir own business!”\\n\\n“Ah, well! It means much the same thing,” said the Duchess, digging her\\nsharp little chin into Alice’s shoulder as she added, “and the moral of\\n_that_ is—‘Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of\\nthemselves.’”\\n\\n“How fond she is of finding morals in things!” Alice thought to\\nherself.\\n\\n“I dare say you’re wondering why I don’t put my arm round your waist,”\\nthe Duchess said after a pause: “the reason is, that I’m doubtful about\\nthe temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?”\\n\\n“He might bite,” Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious\\nto have the experiment tried.\\n\\n“Very true,” said the Duchess: “flamingoes and mustard both bite. And\\nthe moral of that is—‘Birds of a feather flock together.’”\\n\\n“Only mustard isn’t a bird,” Alice remarked.\\n\\n“Right, as usual,” said the Duchess: “what a clear way you have of\\nputting things!”\\n\\n“It’s a mineral, I _think_,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Of course it is,” said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to\\neverything that Alice said; “there’s a large mustard-mine near here.\\nAnd the moral of that is—‘The more there is of mine, the less there is\\nof yours.’”\\n\\n“Oh, I know!” exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last\\nremark, “it’s a vegetable. It doesn’t look like one, but it is.”\\n\\n“I quite agree with you,” said the Duchess; “and the moral of that\\nis—‘Be what you would seem to be’—or if you’d like it put more\\nsimply—‘Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might\\nappear to others that what you were or might have been was not\\notherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be\\notherwise.’”\\n\\n“I think I should understand that better,” Alice said very politely,\\n“if I had it written down: but I can’t quite follow it as you say it.”\\n\\n“That’s nothing to what I could say if I chose,” the Duchess replied,\\nin a pleased tone.\\n\\n“Pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,” said\\nAlice.\\n\\n“Oh, don’t talk about trouble!” said the Duchess. “I make you a present\\nof everything I’ve said as yet.”\\n\\n“A cheap sort of present!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they don’t give\\nbirthday presents like that!” But she did not venture to say it out\\nloud.\\n\\n“Thinking again?” the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp\\nlittle chin.\\n\\n“I’ve a right to think,” said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to\\nfeel a little worried.\\n\\n“Just about as much right,” said the Duchess, “as pigs have to fly; and\\nthe m—”\\n\\nBut here, to Alice’s great surprise, the Duchess’s voice died away,\\neven in the middle of her favourite word ‘moral,’ and the arm that was\\nlinked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the\\nQueen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a\\nthunderstorm.\\n\\n“A fine day, your Majesty!” the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.\\n\\n“Now, I give you fair warning,” shouted the Queen, stamping on the\\nground as she spoke; “either you or your head must be off, and that in\\nabout half no time! Take your choice!”\\n\\nThe Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.\\n\\n“Let’s go on with the game,” the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too\\nmuch frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the\\ncroquet-ground.\\n\\nThe other guests had taken advantage of the Queen’s absence, and were\\nresting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried\\nback to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment’s delay\\nwould cost them their lives.\\n\\nAll the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling\\nwith the other players, and shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with\\nher head!” Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the\\nsoldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so\\nthat by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and\\nall the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody\\nand under sentence of execution.\\n\\nThen the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, “Have\\nyou seen the Mock Turtle yet?”\\n\\n“No,” said Alice. “I don’t even know what a Mock Turtle is.”\\n\\n“It’s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,” said the Queen.\\n\\n“I never saw one, or heard of one,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Come on, then,” said the Queen, “and he shall tell you his history,”\\n\\nAs they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,\\nto the company generally, “You are all pardoned.” “Come, _that’s_ a\\ngood thing!” she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the\\nnumber of executions the Queen had ordered.\\n\\nThey very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If\\nyou don’t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) “Up, lazy\\nthing!” said the Queen, “and take this young lady to see the Mock\\nTurtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some\\nexecutions I have ordered;” and she walked off, leaving Alice alone\\nwith the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature,\\nbut on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it\\nas to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.\\n\\nThe Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till\\nshe was out of sight: then it chuckled. “What fun!” said the Gryphon,\\nhalf to itself, half to Alice.\\n\\n“What _is_ the fun?” said Alice.\\n\\n“Why, _she_,” said the Gryphon. “It’s all her fancy, that: they never\\nexecutes nobody, you know. Come on!”\\n\\n“Everybody says ‘come on!’ here,” thought Alice, as she went slowly\\nafter it: “I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!”\\n\\nThey had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,\\nsitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came\\nnearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She\\npitied him deeply. “What is his sorrow?” she asked the Gryphon, and the\\nGryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, “It’s all\\nhis fancy, that: he hasn’t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!”\\n\\nSo they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes\\nfull of tears, but said nothing.\\n\\n“This here young lady,” said the Gryphon, “she wants for to know your\\nhistory, she do.”\\n\\n“I’ll tell it her,” said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: “sit\\ndown, both of you, and don’t speak a word till I’ve finished.”\\n\\nSo they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to\\nherself, “I don’t see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesn’t begin.”\\nBut she waited patiently.\\n\\n“Once,” said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, “I was a real\\nTurtle.”\\n\\nThese words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an\\noccasional exclamation of “Hjckrrh!” from the Gryphon, and the constant\\nheavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and\\nsaying, “Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,” but she could not\\nhelp thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said\\nnothing.\\n\\n“When we were little,” the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,\\nthough still sobbing a little now and then, “we went to school in the\\nsea. The master was an old Turtle—we used to call him Tortoise—”\\n\\n“Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn’t one?” Alice asked.\\n\\n“We called him Tortoise because he taught us,” said the Mock Turtle\\nangrily: “really you are very dull!”\\n\\n“You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple\\nquestion,” added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked\\nat poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the\\nGryphon said to the Mock Turtle, “Drive on, old fellow! Don’t be all\\nday about it!” and he went on in these words:\\n\\n“Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn’t believe it—”\\n\\n“I never said I didn’t!” interrupted Alice.\\n\\n“You did,” said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\n“Hold your tongue!” added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.\\nThe Mock Turtle went on.\\n\\n“We had the best of educations—in fact, we went to school every day—”\\n\\n“_I’ve_ been to a day-school, too,” said Alice; “you needn’t be so\\nproud as all that.”\\n\\n“With extras?” asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.\\n\\n“Yes,” said Alice, “we learned French and music.”\\n\\n“And washing?” said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\n“Certainly not!” said Alice indignantly.\\n\\n“Ah! then yours wasn’t a really good school,” said the Mock Turtle in a\\ntone of great relief. “Now at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill,\\n‘French, music, _and washing_—extra.’”\\n\\n“You couldn’t have wanted it much,” said Alice; “living at the bottom\\nof the sea.”\\n\\n“I couldn’t afford to learn it.” said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. “I\\nonly took the regular course.”\\n\\n“What was that?” inquired Alice.\\n\\n“Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,” the Mock Turtle\\nreplied; “and then the different branches of Arithmetic—Ambition,\\nDistraction, Uglification, and Derision.”\\n\\n“I never heard of ‘Uglification,’” Alice ventured to say. “What is it?”\\n\\nThe Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. “What! Never heard of\\nuglifying!” it exclaimed. “You know what to beautify is, I suppose?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Alice doubtfully: “it means—to—make—anything—prettier.”\\n\\n“Well, then,” the Gryphon went on, “if you don’t know what to uglify\\nis, you _are_ a simpleton.”\\n\\nAlice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so\\nshe turned to the Mock Turtle, and said “What else had you to learn?”\\n\\n“Well, there was Mystery,” the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the\\nsubjects on his flappers, “—Mystery, ancient and modern, with\\nSeaography: then Drawling—the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,\\nthat used to come once a week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, and\\nFainting in Coils.”\\n\\n“What was _that_ like?” said Alice.\\n\\n“Well, I can’t show it you myself,” the Mock Turtle said: “I’m too\\nstiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.”\\n\\n“Hadn’t time,” said the Gryphon: “I went to the Classics master,\\nthough. He was an old crab, _he_ was.”\\n\\n“I never went to him,” the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: “he taught\\nLaughing and Grief, they used to say.”\\n\\n“So he did, so he did,” said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both\\ncreatures hid their faces in their paws.\\n\\n“And how many hours a day did you do lessons?” said Alice, in a hurry\\nto change the subject.\\n\\n“Ten hours the first day,” said the Mock Turtle: “nine the next, and so\\non.”\\n\\n“What a curious plan!” exclaimed Alice.\\n\\n“That’s the reason they’re called lessons,” the Gryphon remarked:\\n“because they lessen from day to day.”\\n\\nThis was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little\\nbefore she made her next remark. “Then the eleventh day must have been\\na holiday?”\\n\\n“Of course it was,” said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\n“And how did you manage on the twelfth?” Alice went on eagerly.\\n\\n“That’s enough about lessons,” the Gryphon interrupted in a very\\ndecided tone: “tell her something about the games now.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X.\\nThe Lobster Quadrille\\n\\n\\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across\\nhis eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or\\ntwo sobs choked his voice. “Same as if he had a bone in his throat,”\\nsaid the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in\\nthe back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears\\nrunning down his cheeks, he went on again:—\\n\\n“You may not have lived much under the sea—” (“I haven’t,” said\\nAlice)—“and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster—”\\n(Alice began to say “I once tasted—” but checked herself hastily, and\\nsaid “No, never”) “—so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a\\nLobster Quadrille is!”\\n\\n“No, indeed,” said Alice. “What sort of a dance is it?”\\n\\n“Why,” said the Gryphon, “you first form into a line along the\\nsea-shore—”\\n\\n“Two lines!” cried the Mock Turtle. “Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;\\nthen, when you’ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way—”\\n\\n“_That_ generally takes some time,” interrupted the Gryphon.\\n\\n“—you advance twice—”\\n\\n“Each with a lobster as a partner!” cried the Gryphon.\\n\\n“Of course,” the Mock Turtle said: “advance twice, set to partners—”\\n\\n“—change lobsters, and retire in same order,” continued the Gryphon.\\n\\n“Then, you know,” the Mock Turtle went on, “you throw the—”\\n\\n“The lobsters!” shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.\\n\\n“—as far out to sea as you can—”\\n\\n“Swim after them!” screamed the Gryphon.\\n\\n“Turn a somersault in the sea!” cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly\\nabout.\\n\\n“Change lobsters again!” yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.\\n\\n“Back to land again, and that’s all the first figure,” said the Mock\\nTurtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had\\nbeen jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very\\nsadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.\\n\\n“It must be a very pretty dance,” said Alice timidly.\\n\\n“Would you like to see a little of it?” said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\n“Very much indeed,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Come, let’s try the first figure!” said the Mock Turtle to the\\nGryphon. “We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?”\\n\\n“Oh, _you_ sing,” said the Gryphon. “I’ve forgotten the words.”\\n\\nSo they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and\\nthen treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their\\nforepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly\\nand sadly:—\\n\\n“Will you walk a little faster?” said a whiting to a snail.\\n“There’s a porpoise close behind us, and he’s treading on my tail.\\nSee how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!\\nThey are waiting on the shingle—will you come and join the dance?\\nWill you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?\\nWill you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?\\n\\n“You can really have no notion how delightful it will be\\nWhen they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!”\\nBut the snail replied “Too far, too far!” and gave a look askance—\\nSaid he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.\\nWould not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.\\nWould not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.\\n\\n“What matters it how far we go?” his scaly friend replied.\\n“There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.\\nThe further off from England the nearer is to France—\\nThen turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.\\nWill you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?\\nWill you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?”\\n\\n\\n“Thank you, it’s a very interesting dance to watch,” said Alice,\\nfeeling very glad that it was over at last: “and I do so like that\\ncurious song about the whiting!”\\n\\n“Oh, as to the whiting,” said the Mock Turtle, “they—you’ve seen them,\\nof course?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Alice, “I’ve often seen them at dinn—” she checked herself\\nhastily.\\n\\n“I don’t know where Dinn may be,” said the Mock Turtle, “but if you’ve\\nseen them so often, of course you know what they’re like.”\\n\\n“I believe so,” Alice replied thoughtfully. “They have their tails in\\ntheir mouths—and they’re all over crumbs.”\\n\\n“You’re wrong about the crumbs,” said the Mock Turtle: “crumbs would\\nall wash off in the sea. But they _have_ their tails in their mouths;\\nand the reason is—” here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his\\neyes.—“Tell her about the reason and all that,” he said to the Gryphon.\\n\\n“The reason is,” said the Gryphon, “that they _would_ go with the\\nlobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to\\nfall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they\\ncouldn’t get them out again. That’s all.”\\n\\n“Thank you,” said Alice, “it’s very interesting. I never knew so much\\nabout a whiting before.”\\n\\n“I can tell you more than that, if you like,” said the Gryphon. “Do you\\nknow why it’s called a whiting?”\\n\\n“I never thought about it,” said Alice. “Why?”\\n\\n“_It does the boots and shoes_,” the Gryphon replied very solemnly.\\n\\nAlice was thoroughly puzzled. “Does the boots and shoes!” she repeated\\nin a wondering tone.\\n\\n“Why, what are _your_ shoes done with?” said the Gryphon. “I mean, what\\nmakes them so shiny?”\\n\\nAlice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her\\nanswer. “They’re done with blacking, I believe.”\\n\\n“Boots and shoes under the sea,” the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,\\n“are done with a whiting. Now you know.”\\n\\n“And what are they made of?” Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.\\n\\n“Soles and eels, of course,” the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:\\n“any shrimp could have told you that.”\\n\\n“If I’d been the whiting,” said Alice, whose thoughts were still\\nrunning on the song, “I’d have said to the porpoise, ‘Keep back,\\nplease: we don’t want _you_ with us!’”\\n\\n“They were obliged to have him with them,” the Mock Turtle said: “no\\nwise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.”\\n\\n“Wouldn’t it really?” said Alice in a tone of great surprise.\\n\\n“Of course not,” said the Mock Turtle: “why, if a fish came to _me_,\\nand told me he was going a journey, I should say ‘With what porpoise?’”\\n\\n“Don’t you mean ‘purpose’?” said Alice.\\n\\n“I mean what I say,” the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And\\nthe Gryphon added “Come, let’s hear some of _your_ adventures.”\\n\\n“I could tell you my adventures—beginning from this morning,” said\\nAlice a little timidly: “but it’s no use going back to yesterday,\\nbecause I was a different person then.”\\n\\n“Explain all that,” said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\n“No, no! The adventures first,” said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:\\n“explanations take such a dreadful time.”\\n\\nSo Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first\\nsaw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,\\nthe two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened\\ntheir eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she\\nwent on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part\\nabout her repeating “_You are old, Father William_,” to the\\nCaterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock\\nTurtle drew a long breath, and said “That’s very curious.”\\n\\n“It’s all about as curious as it can be,” said the Gryphon.\\n\\n“It all came different!” the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. “I\\nshould like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to\\nbegin.” He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of\\nauthority over Alice.\\n\\n“Stand up and repeat ‘’_Tis the voice of the sluggard_,’” said the\\nGryphon.\\n\\n“How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!”\\nthought Alice; “I might as well be at school at once.” However, she got\\nup, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster\\nQuadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came\\nvery queer indeed:—\\n\\n“’Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,\\n“You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.”\\nAs a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose\\nTrims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.”\\n\\n[later editions continued as follows\\nWhen the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,\\nAnd will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,\\nBut, when the tide rises and sharks are around,\\nHis voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]\\n\\n\\n“That’s different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child,” said\\nthe Gryphon.\\n\\n“Well, I never heard it before,” said the Mock Turtle; “but it sounds\\nuncommon nonsense.”\\n\\nAlice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,\\nwondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again.\\n\\n“I should like to have it explained,” said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\n“She can’t explain it,” said the Gryphon hastily. “Go on with the next\\nverse.”\\n\\n“But about his toes?” the Mock Turtle persisted. “How _could_ he turn\\nthem out with his nose, you know?”\\n\\n“It’s the first position in dancing.” Alice said; but was dreadfully\\npuzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.\\n\\n“Go on with the next verse,” the Gryphon repeated impatiently: “it\\nbegins ‘_I passed by his garden_.’”\\n\\nAlice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come\\nwrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:—\\n\\n“I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,\\nHow the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie—”\\n\\n[later editions continued as follows\\nThe Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,\\nWhile the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.\\nWhen the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,\\nWas kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:\\nWhile the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,\\nAnd concluded the banquet—]\\n\\n\\n“What _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff,” the Mock Turtle\\ninterrupted, “if you don’t explain it as you go on? It’s by far the\\nmost confusing thing _I_ ever heard!”\\n\\n“Yes, I think you’d better leave off,” said the Gryphon: and Alice was\\nonly too glad to do so.\\n\\n“Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?” the Gryphon\\nwent on. “Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?”\\n\\n“Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,” Alice\\nreplied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,\\n“Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her ‘_Turtle Soup_,’ will you, old\\nfellow?”\\n\\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked\\nwith sobs, to sing this:—\\n\\n“Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,\\nWaiting in a hot tureen!\\nWho for such dainties would not stoop?\\nSoup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\\nSoup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\\n    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!\\n    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!\\nSoo—oop of the e—e—evening,\\n    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!\\n\\n“Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,\\nGame, or any other dish?\\nWho would not give all else for two p\\nennyworth only of beautiful Soup?\\nPennyworth only of beautiful Soup?\\n    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!\\n    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!\\nSoo—oop of the e—e—evening,\\n    Beautiful, beauti—FUL SOUP!”\\n\\n\\n“Chorus again!” cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun\\nto repeat it, when a cry of “The trial’s beginning!” was heard in the\\ndistance.\\n\\n“Come on!” cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried\\noff, without waiting for the end of the song.\\n\\n“What trial is it?” Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only\\nanswered “Come on!” and ran the faster, while more and more faintly\\ncame, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:—\\n\\n“Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,\\n    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI.\\nWho Stole the Tarts?\\n\\n\\nThe King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they\\narrived, with a great crowd assembled about them—all sorts of little\\nbirds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was\\nstanding before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard\\nhim; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one\\nhand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the\\ncourt was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so\\ngood, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them—“I wish they’d\\nget the trial done,” she thought, “and hand round the refreshments!”\\nBut there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at\\neverything about her, to pass away the time.\\n\\nAlice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read\\nabout them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew\\nthe name of nearly everything there. “That’s the judge,” she said to\\nherself, “because of his great wig.”\\n\\nThe judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the\\nwig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he\\ndid not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.\\n\\n“And that’s the jury-box,” thought Alice, “and those twelve creatures,”\\n(she was obliged to say “creatures,” you see, because some of them were\\nanimals, and some were birds,) “I suppose they are the jurors.” She\\nsaid this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather\\nproud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little\\ngirls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, “jury-men”\\nwould have done just as well.\\n\\nThe twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. “What are\\nthey doing?” Alice whispered to the Gryphon. “They can’t have anything\\nto put down yet, before the trial’s begun.”\\n\\n“They’re putting down their names,” the Gryphon whispered in reply,\\n“for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.”\\n\\n“Stupid things!” Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she\\nstopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, “Silence in the\\ncourt!” and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round,\\nto make out who was talking.\\n\\nAlice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,\\nthat all the jurors were writing down “stupid things!” on their slates,\\nand she could even make out that one of them didn’t know how to spell\\n“stupid,” and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. “A nice\\nmuddle their slates’ll be in before the trial’s over!” thought Alice.\\n\\nOne of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice\\ncould _not_ stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and\\nvery soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly\\nthat the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out\\nat all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he\\nwas obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this\\nwas of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.\\n\\n“Herald, read the accusation!” said the King.\\n\\nOn this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then\\nunrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:—\\n\\n“The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,\\n    All on a summer day:\\nThe Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,\\n    And took them quite away!”\\n\\n\\n“Consider your verdict,” the King said to the jury.\\n\\n“Not yet, not yet!” the Rabbit hastily interrupted. “There’s a great\\ndeal to come before that!”\\n\\n“Call the first witness,” said the King; and the White Rabbit blew\\nthree blasts on the trumpet, and called out, “First witness!”\\n\\nThe first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand\\nand a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. “I beg pardon, your\\nMajesty,” he began, “for bringing these in: but I hadn’t quite finished\\nmy tea when I was sent for.”\\n\\n“You ought to have finished,” said the King. “When did you begin?”\\n\\nThe Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the\\ncourt, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. “Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it\\nwas,” he said.\\n\\n“Fifteenth,” said the March Hare.\\n\\n“Sixteenth,” added the Dormouse.\\n\\n“Write that down,” the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly\\nwrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and\\nreduced the answer to shillings and pence.\\n\\n“Take off your hat,” the King said to the Hatter.\\n\\n“It isn’t mine,” said the Hatter.\\n\\n“_Stolen!_” the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made\\na memorandum of the fact.\\n\\n“I keep them to sell,” the Hatter added as an explanation; “I’ve none\\nof my own. I’m a hatter.”\\n\\nHere the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,\\nwho turned pale and fidgeted.\\n\\n“Give your evidence,” said the King; “and don’t be nervous, or I’ll\\nhave you executed on the spot.”\\n\\nThis did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting\\nfrom one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his\\nconfusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the\\nbread-and-butter.\\n\\nJust at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled\\nher a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to\\ngrow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave\\nthe court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was\\nas long as there was room for her.\\n\\n“I wish you wouldn’t squeeze so.” said the Dormouse, who was sitting\\nnext to her. “I can hardly breathe.”\\n\\n“I can’t help it,” said Alice very meekly: “I’m growing.”\\n\\n“You’ve no right to grow _here_,” said the Dormouse.\\n\\n“Don’t talk nonsense,” said Alice more boldly: “you know you’re growing\\ntoo.”\\n\\n“Yes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace,” said the Dormouse: “not in\\nthat ridiculous fashion.” And he got up very sulkily and crossed over\\nto the other side of the court.\\n\\nAll this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,\\njust as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers\\nof the court, “Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!”\\non which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes\\noff.\\n\\n“Give your evidence,” the King repeated angrily, “or I’ll have you\\nexecuted, whether you’re nervous or not.”\\n\\n“I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,\\n“—and I hadn’t begun my tea—not above a week or so—and what with the\\nbread-and-butter getting so thin—and the twinkling of the tea—”\\n\\n“The twinkling of the _what?_” said the King.\\n\\n“It _began_ with the tea,” the Hatter replied.\\n\\n“Of course twinkling begins with a T!” said the King sharply. “Do you\\ntake me for a dunce? Go on!”\\n\\n“I’m a poor man,” the Hatter went on, “and most things twinkled after\\nthat—only the March Hare said—”\\n\\n“I didn’t!” the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.\\n\\n“You did!” said the Hatter.\\n\\n“I deny it!” said the March Hare.\\n\\n“He denies it,” said the King: “leave out that part.”\\n\\n“Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said—” the Hatter went on, looking\\nanxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied\\nnothing, being fast asleep.\\n\\n“After that,” continued the Hatter, “I cut some more bread-and-butter—”\\n\\n“But what did the Dormouse say?” one of the jury asked.\\n\\n“That I can’t remember,” said the Hatter.\\n\\n“You _must_ remember,” remarked the King, “or I’ll have you executed.”\\n\\nThe miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went\\ndown on one knee. “I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” he began.\\n\\n“You’re a _very_ poor _speaker_,” said the King.\\n\\nHere one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by\\nthe officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just\\nexplain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied\\nup at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,\\nhead first, and then sat upon it.)\\n\\n“I’m glad I’ve seen that done,” thought Alice. “I’ve so often read in\\nthe newspapers, at the end of trials, “There was some attempts at\\napplause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the\\ncourt,” and I never understood what it meant till now.”\\n\\n“If that’s all you know about it, you may stand down,” continued the\\nKing.\\n\\n“I can’t go no lower,” said the Hatter: “I’m on the floor, as it is.”\\n\\n“Then you may _sit_ down,” the King replied.\\n\\nHere the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.\\n\\n“Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!” thought Alice. “Now we shall get\\non better.”\\n\\n“I’d rather finish my tea,” said the Hatter, with an anxious look at\\nthe Queen, who was reading the list of singers.\\n\\n“You may go,” said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,\\nwithout even waiting to put his shoes on.\\n\\n“—and just take his head off outside,” the Queen added to one of the\\nofficers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get\\nto the door.\\n\\n“Call the next witness!” said the King.\\n\\nThe next witness was the Duchess’s cook. She carried the pepper-box in\\nher hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the\\ncourt, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.\\n\\n“Give your evidence,” said the King.\\n\\n“Shan’t,” said the cook.\\n\\nThe King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,\\n“Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.”\\n\\n“Well, if I must, I must,” the King said, with a melancholy air, and,\\nafter folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were\\nnearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, “What are tarts made of?”\\n\\n“Pepper, mostly,” said the cook.\\n\\n“Treacle,” said a sleepy voice behind her.\\n\\n“Collar that Dormouse,” the Queen shrieked out. “Behead that Dormouse!\\nTurn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his\\nwhiskers!”\\n\\nFor some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse\\nturned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had\\ndisappeared.\\n\\n“Never mind!” said the King, with an air of great relief. “Call the\\nnext witness.” And he added in an undertone to the Queen, “Really, my\\ndear, _you_ must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my\\nforehead ache!”\\n\\nAlice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling\\nvery curious to see what the next witness would be like, “—for they\\nhaven’t got much evidence _yet_,” she said to herself. Imagine her\\nsurprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill\\nlittle voice, the name “Alice!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII.\\nAlice’s Evidence\\n\\n\\n“Here!” cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how\\nlarge she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such\\na hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,\\nupsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there\\nthey lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of\\ngoldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.\\n\\n“Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!” she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and\\nbegan picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident\\nof the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of\\nidea that they must be collected at once and put back into the\\njury-box, or they would die.\\n\\n“The trial cannot proceed,” said the King in a very grave voice, “until\\nall the jurymen are back in their proper places—_all_,” he repeated\\nwith great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.\\n\\nAlice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put\\nthe Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its\\ntail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon\\ngot it out again, and put it right; “not that it signifies much,” she\\nsaid to herself; “I should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the\\ntrial one way up as the other.”\\n\\nAs soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being\\nupset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to\\nthem, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the\\naccident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do\\nanything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the\\ncourt.\\n\\n“What do you know about this business?” the King said to Alice.\\n\\n“Nothing,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Nothing _whatever?_” persisted the King.\\n\\n“Nothing whatever,” said Alice.\\n\\n“That’s very important,” the King said, turning to the jury. They were\\njust beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White\\nRabbit interrupted: “_Un_important, your Majesty means, of course,” he\\nsaid in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as\\nhe spoke.\\n\\n“_Un_important, of course, I meant,” the King hastily said, and went on\\nto himself in an undertone,\\n\\n“important—unimportant—unimportant—important—” as if he were trying\\nwhich word sounded best.\\n\\nSome of the jury wrote it down “important,” and some “unimportant.”\\nAlice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;\\n“but it doesn’t matter a bit,” she thought to herself.\\n\\nAt this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in\\nhis note-book, cackled out “Silence!” and read out from his book, “Rule\\nForty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.”\\n\\nEverybody looked at Alice.\\n\\n“_I’m_ not a mile high,” said Alice.\\n\\n“You are,” said the King.\\n\\n“Nearly two miles high,” added the Queen.\\n\\n“Well, I shan’t go, at any rate,” said Alice: “besides, that’s not a\\nregular rule: you invented it just now.”\\n\\n“It’s the oldest rule in the book,” said the King.\\n\\n“Then it ought to be Number One,” said Alice.\\n\\nThe King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. “Consider your\\nverdict,” he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.\\n\\n“There’s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,” said the\\nWhite Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; “this paper has just been\\npicked up.”\\n\\n“What’s in it?” said the Queen.\\n\\n“I haven’t opened it yet,” said the White Rabbit, “but it seems to be a\\nletter, written by the prisoner to—to somebody.”\\n\\n“It must have been that,” said the King, “unless it was written to\\nnobody, which isn’t usual, you know.”\\n\\n“Who is it directed to?” said one of the jurymen.\\n\\n“It isn’t directed at all,” said the White Rabbit; “in fact, there’s\\nnothing written on the _outside_.” He unfolded the paper as he spoke,\\nand added “It isn’t a letter, after all: it’s a set of verses.”\\n\\n“Are they in the prisoner’s handwriting?” asked another of the jurymen.\\n\\n“No, they’re not,” said the White Rabbit, “and that’s the queerest\\nthing about it.” (The jury all looked puzzled.)\\n\\n“He must have imitated somebody else’s hand,” said the King. (The jury\\nall brightened up again.)\\n\\n“Please your Majesty,” said the Knave, “I didn’t write it, and they\\ncan’t prove I did: there’s no name signed at the end.”\\n\\n“If you didn’t sign it,” said the King, “that only makes the matter\\nworse. You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else you’d have signed\\nyour name like an honest man.”\\n\\nThere was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really\\nclever thing the King had said that day.\\n\\n“That _proves_ his guilt,” said the Queen.\\n\\n“It proves nothing of the sort!” said Alice. “Why, you don’t even know\\nwhat they’re about!”\\n\\n“Read them,” said the King.\\n\\nThe White Rabbit put on his spectacles. “Where shall I begin, please\\nyour Majesty?” he asked.\\n\\n“Begin at the beginning,” the King said gravely, “and go on till you\\ncome to the end: then stop.”\\n\\nThese were the verses the White Rabbit read:—\\n\\n“They told me you had been to her,\\n    And mentioned me to him:\\nShe gave me a good character,\\n    But said I could not swim.\\n\\nHe sent them word I had not gone\\n    (We know it to be true):\\nIf she should push the matter on,\\n    What would become of you?\\n\\nI gave her one, they gave him two,\\n    You gave us three or more;\\nThey all returned from him to you,\\n    Though they were mine before.\\n\\nIf I or she should chance to be\\n    Involved in this affair,\\nHe trusts to you to set them free,\\n    Exactly as we were.\\n\\nMy notion was that you had been\\n    (Before she had this fit)\\nAn obstacle that came between\\n    Him, and ourselves, and it.\\n\\nDon’t let him know she liked them best,\\n    For this must ever be\\nA secret, kept from all the rest,\\n    Between yourself and me.”\\n\\n\\n“That’s the most important piece of evidence we’ve heard yet,” said the\\nKing, rubbing his hands; “so now let the jury—”\\n\\n“If any one of them can explain it,” said Alice, (she had grown so\\nlarge in the last few minutes that she wasn’t a bit afraid of\\ninterrupting him,) “I’ll give him sixpence. _I_ don’t believe there’s\\nan atom of meaning in it.”\\n\\nThe jury all wrote down on their slates, “_She_ doesn’t believe there’s\\nan atom of meaning in it,” but none of them attempted to explain the\\npaper.\\n\\n“If there’s no meaning in it,” said the King, “that saves a world of\\ntrouble, you know, as we needn’t try to find any. And yet I don’t\\nknow,” he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at\\nthem with one eye; “I seem to see some meaning in them, after all.\\n“—_said I could not swim_—” you can’t swim, can you?” he added, turning\\nto the Knave.\\n\\nThe Knave shook his head sadly. “Do I look like it?” he said. (Which he\\ncertainly did _not_, being made entirely of cardboard.)\\n\\n“All right, so far,” said the King, and he went on muttering over the\\nverses to himself: “‘_We know it to be true_—’ that’s the jury, of\\ncourse—‘_I gave her one, they gave him two_—’ why, that must be what he\\ndid with the tarts, you know—”\\n\\n“But, it goes on ‘_they all returned from him to you_,’” said Alice.\\n\\n“Why, there they are!” said the King triumphantly, pointing to the\\ntarts on the table. “Nothing can be clearer than _that_. Then\\nagain—‘_before she had this fit_—’ you never had fits, my dear, I\\nthink?” he said to the Queen.\\n\\n“Never!” said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard\\nas she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his\\nslate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily\\nbegan again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long\\nas it lasted.)\\n\\n“Then the words don’t _fit_ you,” said the King, looking round the\\ncourt with a smile. There was a dead silence.\\n\\n“It’s a pun!” the King added in an offended tone, and everybody\\nlaughed, “Let the jury consider their verdict,” the King said, for\\nabout the twentieth time that day.\\n\\n“No, no!” said the Queen. “Sentence first—verdict afterwards.”\\n\\n“Stuff and nonsense!” said Alice loudly. “The idea of having the\\nsentence first!”\\n\\n“Hold your tongue!” said the Queen, turning purple.\\n\\n“I won’t!” said Alice.\\n\\n“Off with her head!” the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody\\nmoved.\\n\\n“Who cares for you?” said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by\\nthis time.) “You’re nothing but a pack of cards!”\\n\\nAt this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon\\nher: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and\\ntried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her\\nhead in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead\\nleaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.\\n\\n“Wake up, Alice dear!” said her sister; “Why, what a long sleep you’ve\\nhad!”\\n\\n“Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!” said Alice, and she told her\\nsister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange\\nAdventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she\\nhad finished, her sister kissed her, and said, “It _was_ a curious\\ndream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it’s getting late.”\\nSo Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,\\nwhat a wonderful dream it had been.\\n\\n\\nBut her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her\\nhand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all\\nher wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion,\\nand this was her dream:—\\n\\nFirst, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny\\nhands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were\\nlooking up into hers—she could hear the very tones of her voice, and\\nsee that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair\\nthat _would_ always get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or\\nseemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the\\nstrange creatures of her little sister’s dream.\\n\\nThe long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—the\\nfrightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool—she\\ncould hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends\\nshared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen\\nordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more the pig-baby\\nwas sneezing on the Duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed\\naround it—once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the\\nLizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,\\nfilled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock\\nTurtle.\\n\\nSo she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\\nWonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all\\nwould change to dull reality—the grass would be only rustling in the\\nwind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds—the rattling\\nteacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen’s shrill\\ncries to the voice of the shepherd boy—and the sneeze of the baby, the\\nshriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change\\n(she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard—while the\\nlowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock\\nTurtle’s heavy sobs.\\n\\nLastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers\\nwould, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would\\nkeep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her\\nchildhood: and how she would gather about her other little children,\\nand make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,\\nperhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she\\nwould feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all\\ntheir simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer\\ndays.\\n\\nTHE END '"

       "' CHAPTER I Down the Rabbit-Hole   Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no pictures or conversations in it and what is the use of a book thought Alice without pictures or conversations  So she was considering in her own mind as well as she could for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her  There was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself Oh dear Oh dear I shall be late when she thought it over afterwards it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this but at the time it all seemed quite natural but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket and looked at it and then hurried on Alice started to her feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket or a watch to take out of it and burning with curiosity she ran across the field after it and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge  In another moment down went Alice after it never once considering how in the world she was to get out again  The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well  Either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next First she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to see anything then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed it was labelled ORANGE MARMALADE but to her great disappointment it was empty she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it  Well thought Alice to herself after such a fall as this I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs How brave they ll all think me at home Why I wouldn t say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house Which was very likely true  Down down down Would the fall never come to an end I wonder how many miles I ve fallen by this time she said aloud I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth Let me see that would be four thousand miles down I think— for you see Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge as there was no one to listen to her still it was good practice to say it over —yes that s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I ve got to Alice had no idea what Latitude was or Longitude either but thought they were nice grand words to say  Presently she began again I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth How funny it ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward The Antipathies I think— she was rather glad there was no one listening this time as it didn t sound at all the right word —but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is you know Please Ma am is this New Zealand or Australia and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy curtseying as you re falling through the air Do you think you could manage it And what an ignorant little girl she ll think me for asking No it ll never do to ask perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere  Down down down There was nothing else to do so Alice soon began talking again Dinah ll miss me very much to-night I should think Dinah was the cat I hope they ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time Dinah my dear I wish you were down here with me There are no mice in the air I m afraid but you might catch a bat and that s very like a mouse you know But do cats eat bats I wonder And here Alice began to get rather sleepy and went on saying to herself in a dreamy sort of way Do cats eat bats Do cats eat bats and sometimes Do bats eat cats for you see as she couldn t answer either question it didn t much matter which way she put it She felt that she was dozing off and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah and saying to her very earnestly Now Dinah tell me the truth did you ever eat a bat when suddenly thump thump down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves and the fall was over  Alice was not a bit hurt and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment she looked up but it was all dark overhead before her was another long passage and the White Rabbit was still in sight hurrying down it There was not a moment to be lost away went Alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say as it turned a corner Oh my ears and whiskers how late it s getting She was close behind it when she turned the corner but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen she found herself in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof  There were doors all round the hall but they were all locked and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other trying every door she walked sadly down the middle wondering how she was ever to get out again  Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table all made of solid glass there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key and Alice s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall but alas either the locks were too large or the key was too small but at any rate it would not open any of them However on the second time round she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high she tried the little golden key in the lock and to her great delight it fitted  Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage not much larger than a rat-hole she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw How she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains but she could not even get her head through the doorway and even if my head would go through thought poor Alice it would be of very little use without my shoulders Oh how I wish I could shut up like a telescope I think I could if I only knew how to begin For you see so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door so she went back to the table half hoping she might find another key on it or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes this time she found a little bottle on it which certainly was not here before said Alice and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label with the words DRINK ME beautifully printed on it in large letters  It was all very well to say Drink me but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry No I ll look first she said and see whether it s marked ‘poison  or not for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them such as that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife it usually bleeds and she had never forgotten that if you drink much from a bottle marked poison it is almost certain to disagree with you sooner or later  However this bottle was not marked poison so Alice ventured to taste it and finding it very nice it had in fact a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart custard pine-apple roast turkey toffee and hot buttered toast she very soon finished it off                                                                                                                   What a curious feeling said Alice I must be shutting up like a telescope  And so it was indeed she was now only ten inches high and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden First however she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further she felt a little nervous about this for it might end you know said Alice to herself in my going out altogether like a candle I wonder what I should be like then And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing  After a while finding that nothing more happened she decided on going into the garden at once but alas for poor Alice when she got to the door she found she had forgotten the little golden key and when she went back to the table for it she found she could not possibly reach it she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table but it was too slippery and when she had tired herself out with trying the poor little thing sat down and cried  Come there s no use in crying like that said Alice to herself rather sharply I advise you to leave off this minute She generally gave herself very good advice though she very seldom followed it and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people But it s no use now thought poor Alice to pretend to be two people Why there s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person  Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table she opened it and found in it a very small cake on which the words EAT ME were beautifully marked in currants Well I ll eat it said Alice and if it makes me grow larger I can reach the key and if it makes me grow smaller I can creep under the door so either way I ll get into the garden and I don t care which happens  She ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself Which way Which way holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size to be sure this generally happens when one eats cake but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way  So she set to work and very soon finished off the cake                                                                                                                     CHAPTER II The Pool of Tears   Curiouser and curiouser cried Alice she was so much surprised that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English now I m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was Good-bye feet for when she looked down at her feet they seemed to be almost out of sight they were getting so far off Oh my poor little feet I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now dears I m sure I shan t be able I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you you must manage the best way you can—but I must be kind to them thought Alice or perhaps they won t walk the way I want to go Let me see I ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas  And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it They must go by the carrier she thought and how funny it ll seem sending presents to one s own feet And how odd the directions will look       Alice s Right Foot Esq Hearthrug near the Fender with      Alice s love  Oh dear what nonsense I m talking  Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall in fact she was now more than nine feet high and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door  Poor Alice It was as much as she could do lying down on one side to look through into the garden with one eye but to get through was more hopeless than ever she sat down and began to cry again  You ought to be ashamed of yourself said Alice a great girl like you she might well say this to go on crying in this way Stop this moment I tell you But she went on all the same shedding gallons of tears until there was a large pool all round her about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall  After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming It was the White Rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a great hurry muttering to himself as he came Oh the Duchess the Duchess Oh won t she be savage if I ve kept her waiting Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one so when the Rabbit came near her she began in a low timid voice If you please sir— The Rabbit started violently dropped the white kid gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go  Alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking Dear dear How queer everything is to-day And yesterday things went on just as usual I wonder if I ve been changed in the night Let me think was I the same when I got up this morning I almost think I can remember feeling a little different But if I m not the same the next question is Who in the world am I Ah that s the great puzzle And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself to see if she could have been changed for any of them  I m sure I m not Ada she said for her hair goes in such long ringlets and mine doesn t go in ringlets at all and I m sure I can t be Mabel for I know all sorts of things and she oh she knows such a very little Besides she s she and I m I and—oh dear how puzzling it all is I ll try if I know all the things I used to know Let me see four times five is twelve and four times six is thirteen and four times seven is—oh dear I shall never get to twenty at that rate However the Multiplication Table doesn t signify let s try Geography London is the capital of Paris and Paris is the capital of Rome and Rome—no that s all wrong I m certain I must have been changed for Mabel I ll try and say ‘How doth the little—  and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons and began to repeat it but her voice sounded hoarse and strange and the words did not come the same as they used to do—  How doth the little crocodile     Improve his shining tail And pour the waters of the Nile     On every golden scale  How cheerfully he seems to grin     How neatly spread his claws And welcome little fishes in     With gently smiling jaws   I m sure those are not the right words said poor Alice and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on I must be Mabel after all and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house and have next to no toys to play with and oh ever so many lessons to learn No I ve made up my mind about it if I m Mabel I ll stay down here It ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying ‘Come up again dear  I shall only look up and say ‘Who am I then Tell me that first and then if I like being that person I ll come up if not I ll stay down here till I m somebody else —but oh dear cried Alice with a sudden burst of tears I do wish they would put their heads down I am so very tired of being all alone here  As she said this she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit s little white kid gloves while she was talking How can I have done that she thought I must be growing small again She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it and found that as nearly as she could guess she was now about two feet high and was going on shrinking rapidly she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether  That was a narrow escape said Alice a good deal frightened at the sudden change but very glad to find herself still in existence and now for the garden and she ran with all speed back to the little door but alas the little door was shut again and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before and things are worse than ever thought the poor child for I never was so small as this before never And I declare it s too bad that it is  As she said these words her foot slipped and in another moment splash she was up to her chin in salt water Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea and in that case I can go back by railway she said to herself Alice had been to the seaside once in her life and had come to the general conclusion that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea some children digging in the sand with wooden spades then a row of lodging houses and behind them a railway station However she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high  I wish I hadn t cried so much said Alice as she swam about trying to find her way out I shall be punished for it now I suppose by being drowned in my own tears That will be a queer thing to be sure However everything is queer to-day  Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off and she swam nearer to make out what it was at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus but then she remembered how small she was now and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself  Would it be of any use now thought Alice to speak to this mouse Everything is so out-of-the-way down here that I should think very likely it can talk at any rate there s no harm in trying So she began O Mouse do you know the way out of this pool I am very tired of swimming about here O Mouse Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse she had never done such a thing before but she remembered having seen in her brother s Latin Grammar A mouse—of a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes but it said nothing  Perhaps it doesn t understand English thought Alice I daresay it s a French mouse come over with William the Conqueror For with all her knowledge of history Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened So she began again Où est ma chatte which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright Oh I beg your pardon cried Alice hastily afraid that she had hurt the poor animal s feelings I quite forgot you didn t like cats  Not like cats cried the Mouse in a shrill passionate voice Would you like cats if you were me  Well perhaps not said Alice in a soothing tone don t be angry about it And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah I think you d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her She is such a dear quiet thing Alice went on half to herself as she swam lazily about in the pool and she sits purring so nicely by the fire licking her paws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse—and she s such a capital one for catching mice—oh I beg your pardon cried Alice again for this time the Mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended We won t talk about her any more if you d rather not  We indeed cried the Mouse who was trembling down to the end of his tail As if I would talk on such a subject Our family always hated cats nasty low vulgar things Don t let me hear the name again  I won t indeed said Alice in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs The Mouse did not answer so Alice went on eagerly There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you A little bright-eyed terrier you know with oh such long curly brown hair And it ll fetch things when you throw them and it ll sit up and beg for its dinner and all sorts of things—I can t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer you know and he says it s so useful it s worth a hundred pounds He says it kills all the rats and—oh dear cried Alice in a sorrowful tone I m afraid I ve offended it again For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went  So she called softly after it Mouse dear Do come back again and we won t talk about cats or dogs either if you don t like them When the Mouse heard this it turned round and swam slowly back to her its face was quite pale with passion Alice thought and it said in a low trembling voice Let us get to the shore and then I ll tell you my history and you ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs  It was high time to go for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it there were a Duck and a Dodo a Lory and an Eaglet and several other curious creatures Alice led the way and the whole party swam to the shore     CHAPTER III A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale   They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the birds with draggled feathers the animals with their fur clinging close to them and all dripping wet cross and uncomfortable  The first question of course was how to get dry again they had a consultation about this and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them as if she had known them all her life Indeed she had quite a long argument with the Lory who at last turned sulky and would only say I am older than you and must know better and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was and as the Lory positively refused to tell its age there was no more to be said  At last the Mouse who seemed to be a person of authority among them called out Sit down all of you and listen to me I ll soon make you dry enough They all sat down at once in a large ring with the Mouse in the middle Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon  Ahem said the Mouse with an important air are you all ready This is the driest thing I know Silence all round if you please ‘William the Conqueror whose cause was favoured by the pope was soon submitted to by the English who wanted leaders and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest Edwin and Morcar the earls of Mercia and Northumbria—   Ugh said the Lory with a shiver  I beg your pardon said the Mouse frowning but very politely Did you speak  Not I said the Lory hastily  I thought you did said the Mouse —I proceed ‘Edwin and Morcar the earls of Mercia and Northumbria declared for him and even Stigand the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury found it advisable—   Found what said the Duck  Found it the Mouse replied rather crossly of course you know what ‘it  means  I know what ‘it  means well enough when I find a thing said the Duck it s generally a frog or a worm The question is what did the archbishop find  The Mouse did not notice this question but hurriedly went on ‘—found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown William s conduct at first was moderate But the insolence of his Normans—  How are you getting on now my dear it continued turning to Alice as it spoke  As wet as ever said Alice in a melancholy tone it doesn t seem to dry me at all  In that case said the Dodo solemnly rising to its feet I move that the meeting adjourn for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies—  Speak English said the Eaglet I don t know the meaning of half those long words and what s more I don t believe you do either And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile some of the other birds tittered audibly  What I was going to say said the Dodo in an offended tone was that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race  What is a Caucus-race said Alice not that she wanted much to know but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak and no one else seemed inclined to say anything  Why said the Dodo the best way to explain it is to do it And as you might like to try the thing yourself some winter day I will tell you how the Dodo managed it  First it marked out a race-course in a sort of circle the exact shape doesn t matter it said and then all the party were placed along the course here and there There was no One two three and away but they began running when they liked and left off when they liked so that it was not easy to know when the race was over However when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite dry again the Dodo suddenly called out The race is over and they all crowded round it panting and asking But who has won  This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead the position in which you usually see Shakespeare in the pictures of him while the rest waited in silence At last the Dodo said Everybody has won and all must have prizes  But who is to give the prizes quite a chorus of voices asked  Why she of course said the Dodo pointing to Alice with one finger and the whole party at once crowded round her calling out in a confused way Prizes Prizes  Alice had no idea what to do and in despair she put her hand in her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits luckily the salt water had not got into it and handed them round as prizes There was exactly one a-piece all round  But she must have a prize herself you know said the Mouse  Of course the Dodo replied very gravely What else have you got in your pocket he went on turning to Alice  Only a thimble said Alice sadly  Hand it over here said the Dodo  Then they all crowded round her once more while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble saying We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble and when it had finished this short speech they all cheered  Alice thought the whole thing very absurd but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh and as she could not think of anything to say she simply bowed and took the thimble looking as solemn as she could  The next thing was to eat the comfits this caused some noise and confusion as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back However it was over at last and they sat down again in a ring and begged the Mouse to tell them something more  You promised to tell me your history you know said Alice and why it is you hate—C and D she added in a whisper half afraid that it would be offended again  Mine is a long and a sad tale said the Mouse turning to Alice and sighing  It is a long tail certainly said Alice looking down with wonder at the Mouse s tail but why do you call it sad And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking so that her idea of the tale was something like this—           Fury said to a mouse That he met in the house ‘Let us both          go to law I will prosecute you—Come I ll take no          denial We must have a trial For really this morning I ve          nothing to do  Said the mouse to the cur ‘Such a trial dear          sir With no jury or judge would be wasting our breath           ‘I ll be judge I ll be jury  Said cunning old Fury ‘I ll          try the whole cause and condemn you to death   You are not attending said the Mouse to Alice severely What are you thinking of  I beg your pardon said Alice very humbly you had got to the fifth bend I think  I had not cried the Mouse sharply and very angrily  A knot said Alice always ready to make herself useful and looking anxiously about her Oh do let me help to undo it  I shall do nothing of the sort said the Mouse getting up and walking away You insult me by talking such nonsense  I didn t mean it pleaded poor Alice But you re so easily offended you know  The Mouse only growled in reply  Please come back and finish your story Alice called after it and the others all joined in chorus Yes please do but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked a little quicker  What a pity it wouldn t stay sighed the Lory as soon as it was quite out of sight and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter Ah my dear Let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper Hold your tongue Ma said the young Crab a little snappishly You re enough to try the patience of an oyster  I wish I had our Dinah here I know I do said Alice aloud addressing nobody in particular She d soon fetch it back  And who is Dinah if I might venture to ask the question said the Lory  Alice replied eagerly for she was always ready to talk about her pet Dinah s our cat And she s such a capital one for catching mice you can t think And oh I wish you could see her after the birds Why she ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it  This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party Some of the birds hurried off at once one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully remarking I really must be getting home the night-air doesn t suit my throat and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children Come away my dears It s high time you were all in bed On various pretexts they all moved off and Alice was soon left alone  I wish I hadn t mentioned Dinah she said to herself in a melancholy tone Nobody seems to like her down here and I m sure she s the best cat in the world Oh my dear Dinah I wonder if I shall ever see you any more And here poor Alice began to cry again for she felt very lonely and low-spirited In a little while however she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance and she looked up eagerly half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind and was coming back to finish his story     CHAPTER IV The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill   It was the White Rabbit trotting slowly back again and looking anxiously about as it went as if it had lost something and she heard it muttering to itself The Duchess The Duchess Oh my dear paws Oh my fur and whiskers She ll get me executed as sure as ferrets are ferrets Where can I have dropped them I wonder Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them but they were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool and the great hall with the glass table and the little door had vanished completely  Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice as she went hunting about and called out to her in an angry tone Why Mary Ann what are you doing out here Run home this moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan Quick now And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to without trying to explain the mistake it had made  He took me for his housemaid she said to herself as she ran How surprised he ll be when he finds out who I am But I d better take him his fan and gloves—that is if I can find them As she said this she came upon a neat little house on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name W RABBIT engraved upon it She went in without knocking and hurried upstairs in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves  How queer it seems Alice said to herself to be going messages for a rabbit I suppose Dinah ll be sending me on messages next And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen ‘Miss Alice Come here directly and get ready for your walk  ‘Coming in a minute nurse But I ve got to see that the mouse doesn t get out  Only I don t think Alice went on that they d let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that  By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window and on it as she had hoped a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass There was no label this time with the words DRINK ME but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips I know something interesting is sure to happen she said to herself whenever I eat or drink anything so I ll just see what this bottle does I do hope it ll make me grow large again for really I m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing  It did so indeed and much sooner than she had expected before she had drunk half the bottle she found her head pressing against the ceiling and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken She hastily put down the bottle saying to herself That s quite enough—I hope I shan t grow any more—As it is I can t get out at the door—I do wish I hadn t drunk quite so much  Alas it was too late to wish that She went on growing and growing and very soon had to kneel down on the floor in another minute there was not even room for this and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door and the other arm curled round her head Still she went on growing and as a last resource she put one arm out of the window and one foot up the chimney and said to herself Now I can do no more whatever happens What will become of me  Luckily for Alice the little magic bottle had now had its full effect and she grew no larger still it was very uncomfortable and as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again no wonder she felt unhappy  It was much pleasanter at home thought poor Alice when one wasn t always growing larger and smaller and being ordered about by mice and rabbits I almost wish I hadn t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and yet—it s rather curious you know this sort of life I do wonder what can have happened to me When I used to read fairy-tales I fancied that kind of thing never happened and now here I am in the middle of one There ought to be a book written about me that there ought And when I grow up I ll write one—but I m grown up now she added in a sorrowful tone at least there s no room to grow up any more here  But then thought Alice shall I never get any older than I am now That ll be a comfort one way—never to be an old woman—but then—always to have lessons to learn Oh I shouldn t like that  Oh you foolish Alice she answered herself How can you learn lessons in here Why there s hardly room for you and no room at all for any lesson-books  And so she went on taking first one side and then the other and making quite a conversation of it altogether but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside and stopped to listen  Mary Ann Mary Ann said the voice Fetch me my gloves this moment Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the house quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it  Presently the Rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it but as the door opened inwards and Alice s elbow was pressed hard against it that attempt proved a failure Alice heard it say to itself Then I ll go round and get in at the window  That you won t thought Alice and after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window she suddenly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air She did not get hold of anything but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame or something of the sort  Next came an angry voice—the Rabbit s—Pat Pat Where are you And then a voice she had never heard before Sure then I m here Digging for apples yer honour  Digging for apples indeed said the Rabbit angrily Here Come and help me out of this Sounds of more broken glass  Now tell me Pat what s that in the window  Sure it s an arm yer honour He pronounced it arrum  An arm you goose Who ever saw one that size Why it fills the whole window  Sure it does yer honour but it s an arm for all that  Well it s got no business there at any rate go and take it away  There was a long silence after this and Alice could only hear whispers now and then such as Sure I don t like it yer honour at all at all Do as I tell you you coward and at last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air This time there were two little shrieks and more sounds of broken glass What a number of cucumber-frames there must be thought Alice I wonder what they ll do next As for pulling me out of the window I only wish they could I m sure I don t want to stay in here any longer  She waited for some time without hearing anything more at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels and the sound of a good many voices all talking together she made out the words Where s the other ladder—Why I hadn t to bring but one Bill s got the other—Bill fetch it here lad—Here put  em up at this corner—No tie  em together first—they don t reach half high enough yet—Oh they ll do well enough don t be particular—Here Bill catch hold of this rope—Will the roof bear—Mind that loose slate—Oh it s coming down Heads below a loud crash—Now who did that—It was Bill I fancy—Who s to go down the chimney—Nay I shan t You do it—That I won t then—Bill s to go down—Here Bill the master says you re to go down the chimney  Oh So Bill s got to come down the chimney has he said Alice to herself Shy they seem to put everything upon Bill I wouldn t be in Bill s place for a good deal this fireplace is narrow to be sure but I think I can kick a little  She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal she couldn t guess of what sort it was scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her then saying to herself This is Bill she gave one sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next  The first thing she heard was a general chorus of There goes Bill then the Rabbit s voice along—Catch him you by the hedge then silence and then another confusion of voices—Hold up his head—Brandy now—Don t choke him—How was it old fellow What happened to you Tell us all about it  Last came a little feeble squeaking voice That s Bill thought Alice Well I hardly know—No more thank ye I m better now—but I m a deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box and up I goes like a sky-rocket  So you did old fellow said the others  We must burn the house down said the Rabbit s voice and Alice called out as loud as she could If you do I ll set Dinah at you  There was a dead silence instantly and Alice thought to herself I wonder what they will do next If they had any sense they d take the roof off After a minute or two they began moving about again and Alice heard the Rabbit say A barrowful will do to begin with  A barrowful of what thought Alice but she had not long to doubt for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face I ll put a stop to this she said to herself and shouted out You d better not do that again which produced another dead silence  Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head If I eat one of these cakes she thought it s sure to make some change in my size and as it can t possibly make me larger it must make me smaller I suppose  So she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly As soon as she was small enough to get through the door she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside The poor little Lizard Bill was in the middle being held up by two guinea-pigs who were giving it something out of a bottle They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in a thick wood  The first thing I ve got to do said Alice to herself as she wandered about in the wood is to grow to my right size again and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden I think that will be the best plan  It sounded an excellent plan no doubt and very neatly and simply arranged the only difficulty was that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry  An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes and feebly stretching out one paw trying to touch her Poor little thing said Alice in a coaxing tone and she tried hard to whistle to it but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing  Hardly knowing what she did she picked up a little bit of stick and held it out to the puppy whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once with a yelp of delight and rushed at the stick and made believe to worry it then Alice dodged behind a great thistle to keep herself from being run over and the moment she appeared on the other side the puppy made another rush at the stick and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it then Alice thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet ran round the thistle again then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back and barking hoarsely all the while till at last it sat down a good way off panting with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and its great eyes half shut  This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape so she set off at once and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath and till the puppy s bark sounded quite faint in the distance  And yet what a dear little puppy it was said Alice as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself and fanned herself with one of the leaves I should have liked teaching it tricks very much if—if I d only been the right size to do it Oh dear I d nearly forgotten that I ve got to grow up again Let me see—how is it to be managed I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other but the great question is what  The great question certainly was what Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances There was a large mushroom growing near her about the same height as herself and when she had looked under it and on both sides of it and behind it it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it  She stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge of the mushroom and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar that was sitting on the top with its arms folded quietly smoking a long hookah and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else     CHAPTER V Advice from a Caterpillar   The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and addressed her in a languid sleepy voice  Who are you said the Caterpillar  This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation Alice replied rather shyly I—I hardly know sir just at present—at least I know who I was when I got up this morning but I think I must have been changed several times since then  What do you mean by that said the Caterpillar sternly Explain yourself  I can t explain myself I m afraid sir said Alice because I m not myself you see  I don t see said the Caterpillar  I m afraid I can t put it more clearly Alice replied very politely for I can t understand it myself to begin with and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing  It isn t said the Caterpillar  Well perhaps you haven t found it so yet said Alice but when you have to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day you know—and then after that into a butterfly I should think you ll feel it a little queer won t you  Not a bit said the Caterpillar  Well perhaps your feelings may be different said Alice all I know is it would feel very queer to me  You said the Caterpillar contemptuously Who are you  Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar s making such very short remarks and she drew herself up and said very gravely I think you ought to tell me who you are first  Why said the Caterpillar  Here was another puzzling question and as Alice could not think of any good reason and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind she turned away  Come back the Caterpillar called after her I ve something important to say  This sounded promising certainly Alice turned and came back again  Keep your temper said the Caterpillar  Is that all said Alice swallowing down her anger as well as she could  No said the Caterpillar  Alice thought she might as well wait as she had nothing else to do and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing For some minutes it puffed away without speaking but at last it unfolded its arms took the hookah out of its mouth again and said So you think you re changed do you  I m afraid I am sir said Alice I can t remember things as I used—and I don t keep the same size for ten minutes together  Can t remember what things said the Caterpillar  Well I ve tried to say How doth the little busy bee but it all came different Alice replied in a very melancholy voice  Repeat You are old Father William  said the Caterpillar  Alice folded her hands and began—  You are old Father William the young man said     And your hair has become very white And yet you incessantly stand on your head—     Do you think at your age it is right  In my youth Father William replied to his son     I feared it might injure the brain But now that I m perfectly sure I have none     Why I do it again and again  You are old said the youth as I mentioned before     And have grown most uncommonly fat Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—     Pray what is the reason of that  In my youth said the sage as he shook his grey locks     I kept all my limbs very supple By the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—     Allow me to sell you a couple  You are old said the youth and your jaws are too weak     For anything tougher than suet Yet you finished the goose with the bones and the beak—     Pray how did you manage to do it  In my youth said his father I took to the law     And argued each case with my wife And the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw     Has lasted the rest of my life  You are old said the youth one would hardly suppose     That your eye was as steady as ever Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—     What made you so awfully clever  I have answered three questions and that is enough     Said his father don t give yourself airs Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff     Be off or I ll kick you down stairs   That is not said right said the Caterpillar  Not quite right I m afraid said Alice timidly some of the words have got altered  It is wrong from beginning to end said the Caterpillar decidedly and there was silence for some minutes  The Caterpillar was the first to speak  What size do you want to be it asked  Oh I m not particular as to size Alice hastily replied only one doesn t like changing so often you know  I don t know said the Caterpillar  Alice said nothing she had never been so much contradicted in her life before and she felt that she was losing her temper  Are you content now said the Caterpillar  Well I should like to be a little larger sir if you wouldn t mind said Alice three inches is such a wretched height to be  It is a very good height indeed said the Caterpillar angrily rearing itself upright as it spoke it was exactly three inches high  But I m not used to it pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone And she thought of herself I wish the creatures wouldn t be so easily offended  You ll get used to it in time said the Caterpillar and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again  This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice and shook itself Then it got down off the mushroom and crawled away in the grass merely remarking as it went One side will make you grow taller and the other side will make you grow shorter  One side of what The other side of what thought Alice to herself  Of the mushroom said the Caterpillar just as if she had asked it aloud and in another moment it was out of sight  Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute trying to make out which were the two sides of it and as it was perfectly round she found this a very difficult question However at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand  And now which is which she said to herself and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin it had struck her foot  She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change but she felt that there was no time to be lost as she was shrinking rapidly so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open her mouth but she did it at last and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit                                                                                                                   Come my head s free at last said Alice in a tone of delight which changed into alarm in another moment when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found all she could see when she looked down was an immense length of neck which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her  What can all that green stuff be said Alice And where have my shoulders got to And oh my poor hands how is it I can t see you She was moving them about as she spoke but no result seemed to follow except a little shaking among the distant green leaves  As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head she tried to get her head down to them and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction like a serpent She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to dive in among the leaves which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its wings  Serpent screamed the Pigeon  I m not a serpent said Alice indignantly Let me alone  Serpent I say again repeated the Pigeon but in a more subdued tone and added with a kind of sob I ve tried every way and nothing seems to suit them  I haven t the least idea what you re talking about said Alice  I ve tried the roots of trees and I ve tried banks and I ve tried hedges the Pigeon went on without attending to her but those serpents There s no pleasing them  Alice was more and more puzzled but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished  As if it wasn t trouble enough hatching the eggs said the Pigeon but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day Why I haven t had a wink of sleep these three weeks  I m very sorry you ve been annoyed said Alice who was beginning to see its meaning  And just as I d taken the highest tree in the wood continued the Pigeon raising its voice to a shriek and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last they must needs come wriggling down from the sky Ugh Serpent  But I m not a serpent I tell you said Alice I m a—I m a—  Well What are you said the Pigeon I can see you re trying to invent something  I—I m a little girl said Alice rather doubtfully as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day  A likely story indeed said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt I ve seen a good many little girls in my time but never one with such a neck as that No no You re a serpent and there s no use denying it I suppose you ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg  I have tasted eggs certainly said Alice who was a very truthful child but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do you know  I don t believe it said the Pigeon but if they do why then they re a kind of serpent that s all I can say  This was such a new idea to Alice that she was quite silent for a minute or two which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding You re looking for eggs I know that well enough and what does it matter to me whether you re a little girl or a serpent  It matters a good deal to me said Alice hastily but I m not looking for eggs as it happens and if I was I shouldn t want yours I don t like them raw  Well be off then said the Pigeon in a sulky tone as it settled down again into its nest Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands and she set to work very carefully nibbling first at one and then at the other and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height  It was so long since she had been anything near the right size that it felt quite strange at first but she got used to it in a few minutes and began talking to herself as usual Come there s half my plan done now How puzzling all these changes are I m never sure what I m going to be from one minute to another However I ve got back to my right size the next thing is to get into that beautiful garden—how is that to be done I wonder As she said this she came suddenly upon an open place with a little house in it about four feet high Whoever lives there thought Alice it ll never do to come upon them this size why I should frighten them out of their wits So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high     CHAPTER VI Pig and Pepper   For a minute or two she stood looking at the house and wondering what to do next when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood—she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery otherwise judging by his face only she would have called him a fish—and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles It was opened by another footman in livery with a round face and large eyes like a frog and both footmen Alice noticed had powdered hair that curled all over their heads She felt very curious to know what it was all about and crept a little way out of the wood to listen  The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter nearly as large as himself and this he handed over to the other saying in a solemn tone For the Duchess An invitation from the Queen to play croquet The Frog-Footman repeated in the same solemn tone only changing the order of the words a little From the Queen An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet  Then they both bowed low and their curls got entangled together  Alice laughed so much at this that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her and when she next peeped out the Fish-Footman was gone and the other was sitting on the ground near the door staring stupidly up into the sky  Alice went timidly up to the door and knocked  There s no sort of use in knocking said the Footman and that for two reasons First because I m on the same side of the door as you are secondly because they re making such a noise inside no one could possibly hear you And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within—a constant howling and sneezing and every now and then a great crash as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces  Please then said Alice how am I to get in  There might be some sense in your knocking the Footman went on without attending to her if we had the door between us For instance if you were inside you might knock and I could let you out you know He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil But perhaps he can t help it she said to herself his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head But at any rate he might answer questions—How am I to get in she repeated aloud  I shall sit here the Footman remarked till tomorrow—  At this moment the door of the house opened and a large plate came skimming out straight at the Footman s head it just grazed his nose and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him  —or next day maybe the Footman continued in the same tone exactly as if nothing had happened  How am I to get in asked Alice again in a louder tone  Are you to get in at all said the Footman That s the first question you know  It was no doubt only Alice did not like to be told so It s really dreadful she muttered to herself the way all the creatures argue It s enough to drive one crazy  The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark with variations I shall sit here he said on and off for days and days  But what am I to do said Alice  Anything you like said the Footman and began whistling  Oh there s no use in talking to him said Alice desperately he s perfectly idiotic And she opened the door and went in  The door led right into a large kitchen which was full of smoke from one end to the other the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle nursing a baby the cook was leaning over the fire stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup  There s certainly too much pepper in that soup Alice said to herself as well as she could for sneezing  There was certainly too much of it in the air Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally and as for the baby it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment s pause The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze were the cook and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear  Please would you tell me said Alice a little timidly for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first why your cat grins like that  It s a Cheshire cat said the Duchess and that s why Pig  She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby and not to her so she took courage and went on again—  I didn t know that Cheshire cats always grinned in fact I didn t know that cats could grin  They all can said the Duchess and most of  em do  I don t know of any that do Alice said very politely feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation  You don t know much said the Duchess and that s a fact  Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation While she was trying to fix on one the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first then followed a shower of saucepans plates and dishes The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her and the baby was howling so much already that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not  Oh please mind what you re doing cried Alice jumping up and down in an agony of terror Oh there goes his precious nose as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it and very nearly carried it off  If everybody minded their own business the Duchess said in a hoarse growl the world would go round a deal faster than it does  Which would not be an advantage said Alice who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge Just think of what work it would make with the day and night You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis—  Talking of axes said the Duchess chop off her head  Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook to see if she meant to take the hint but the cook was busily stirring the soup and seemed not to be listening so she went on again Twenty-four hours I think or is it twelve I—  Oh don t bother me said the Duchess I never could abide figures And with that she began nursing her child again singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line  Speak roughly to your little boy     And beat him when he sneezes He only does it to annoy     Because he knows it teases   CHORUS In which the cook and the baby joined   Wow wow wow   While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song she kept tossing the baby violently up and down and the poor little thing howled so that Alice could hardly hear the words—  I speak severely to my boy     I beat him when he sneezes For he can thoroughly enjoy     The pepper when he pleases   CHORUS   Wow wow wow   Here you may nurse it a bit if you like the Duchess said to Alice flinging the baby at her as she spoke I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen and she hurried out of the room The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out but it just missed her  Alice caught the baby with some difficulty as it was a queer-shaped little creature and held out its arms and legs in all directions just like a star-fish thought Alice The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again so that altogether for the first minute or two it was as much as she could do to hold it  As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it which was to twist it up into a sort of knot and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot so as to prevent its undoing itself she carried it out into the open air If I don t take this child away with me thought Alice they re sure to kill it in a day or two wouldn t it be murder to leave it behind She said the last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply it had left off sneezing by this time Don t grunt said Alice that s not at all a proper way of expressing yourself  The baby grunted again and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it There could be no doubt that it had a very turn-up nose much more like a snout than a real nose also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at all But perhaps it was only sobbing she thought and looked into its eyes again to see if there were any tears  No there were no tears If you re going to turn into a pig my dear said Alice seriously I ll have nothing more to do with you Mind now The poor little thing sobbed again or grunted it was impossible to say which and they went on for some while in silence  Alice was just beginning to think to herself Now what am I to do with this creature when I get it home when it grunted again so violently that she looked down into its face in some alarm This time there could be no mistake about it it was neither more nor less than a pig and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further  So she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood If it had grown up she said to herself it would have made a dreadfully ugly child but it makes rather a handsome pig I think And she began thinking over other children she knew who might do very well as pigs and was just saying to herself if one only knew the right way to change them— when she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off  The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice It looked good-natured she thought still it had very long claws and a great many teeth so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect  Cheshire Puss she began rather timidly as she did not at all know whether it would like the name however it only grinned a little wider Come it s pleased so far thought Alice and she went on Would you tell me please which way I ought to go from here  That depends a good deal on where you want to get to said the Cat  I don t much care where— said Alice  Then it doesn t matter which way you go said the Cat  —so long as I get somewhere Alice added as an explanation  Oh you re sure to do that said the Cat if you only walk long enough  Alice felt that this could not be denied so she tried another question What sort of people live about here  In that direction the Cat said waving its right paw round lives a Hatter and in that direction waving the other paw lives a March Hare Visit either you like they re both mad  But I don t want to go among mad people Alice remarked  Oh you can t help that said the Cat we re all mad here I m mad You re mad  How do you know I m mad said Alice  You must be said the Cat or you wouldn t have come here  Alice didn t think that proved it at all however she went on And how do you know that you re mad  To begin with said the Cat a dog s not mad You grant that  I suppose so said Alice  Well then the Cat went on you see a dog growls when it s angry and wags its tail when it s pleased Now I growl when I m pleased and wag my tail when I m angry Therefore I m mad  I call it purring not growling said Alice  Call it what you like said the Cat Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day  I should like it very much said Alice but I haven t been invited yet  You ll see me there said the Cat and vanished  Alice was not much surprised at this she was getting so used to queer things happening While she was looking at the place where it had been it suddenly appeared again  By-the-bye what became of the baby said the Cat I d nearly forgotten to ask  It turned into a pig Alice quietly said just as if it had come back in a natural way  I thought it would said the Cat and vanished again  Alice waited a little half expecting to see it again but it did not appear and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live I ve seen hatters before she said to herself the March Hare will be much the most interesting and perhaps as this is May it won t be raving mad—at least not so mad as it was in March As she said this she looked up and there was the Cat again sitting on a branch of a tree  Did you say pig or fig said the Cat  I said pig replied Alice and I wish you wouldn t keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly you make one quite giddy  All right said the Cat and this time it vanished quite slowly beginning with the end of the tail and ending with the grin which remained some time after the rest of it had gone  Well I ve often seen a cat without a grin thought Alice but a grin without a cat It s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life  She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare she thought it must be the right house because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur It was so large a house that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom and raised herself to about two feet high even then she walked up towards it rather timidly saying to herself Suppose it should be raving mad after all I almost wish I d gone to see the Hatter instead     CHAPTER VII A Mad Tea-Party   There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it a Dormouse was sitting between them fast asleep and the other two were using it as a cushion resting their elbows on it and talking over its head Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse thought Alice only as it s asleep I suppose it doesn t mind  The table was a large one but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it No room No room they cried out when they saw Alice coming There s plenty of room said Alice indignantly and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table  Have some wine the March Hare said in an encouraging tone  Alice looked all round the table but there was nothing on it but tea I don t see any wine she remarked  There isn t any said the March Hare  Then it wasn t very civil of you to offer it said Alice angrily  It wasn t very civil of you to sit down without being invited said the March Hare  I didn t know it was your table said Alice it s laid for a great many more than three  Your hair wants cutting said the Hatter He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity and this was his first speech  You should learn not to make personal remarks Alice said with some severity it s very rude  The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all he said was Why is a raven like a writing-desk  Come we shall have some fun now thought Alice I m glad they ve begun asking riddles—I believe I can guess that she added aloud  Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it said the March Hare  Exactly so said Alice  Then you should say what you mean the March Hare went on  I do Alice hastily replied at least—at least I mean what I say—that s the same thing you know  Not the same thing a bit said the Hatter You might just as well say that ‘I see what I eat  is the same thing as ‘I eat what I see   You might just as well say added the March Hare that ‘I like what I get  is the same thing as ‘I get what I like   You might just as well say added the Dormouse who seemed to be talking in his sleep that ‘I breathe when I sleep  is the same thing as ‘I sleep when I breathe   It is the same thing with you said the Hatter and here the conversation dropped and the party sat silent for a minute while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks which wasn t much  The Hatter was the first to break the silence What day of the month is it he said turning to Alice he had taken his watch out of his pocket and was looking at it uneasily shaking it every now and then and holding it to his ear  Alice considered a little and then said The fourth  Two days wrong sighed the Hatter I told you butter wouldn t suit the works he added looking angrily at the March Hare  It was the best butter the March Hare meekly replied  Yes but some crumbs must have got in as well the Hatter grumbled you shouldn t have put it in with the bread-knife  The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily then he dipped it into his cup of tea and looked at it again but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark It was the best butter you know  Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity What a funny watch she remarked It tells the day of the month and doesn t tell what o clock it is  Why should it muttered the Hatter Does your watch tell you what year it is  Of course not Alice replied very readily but that s because it stays the same year for such a long time together  Which is just the case with mine said the Hatter  Alice felt dreadfully puzzled The Hatter s remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it and yet it was certainly English I don t quite understand you she said as politely as she could  The Dormouse is asleep again said the Hatter and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose  The Dormouse shook its head impatiently and said without opening its eyes Of course of course just what I was going to remark myself  Have you guessed the riddle yet the Hatter said turning to Alice again  No I give it up Alice replied what s the answer  I haven t the slightest idea said the Hatter  Nor I said the March Hare  Alice sighed wearily I think you might do something better with the time she said than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers  If you knew Time as well as I do said the Hatter you wouldn t talk about wasting it It s him  I don t know what you mean said Alice  Of course you don t the Hatter said tossing his head contemptuously I dare say you never even spoke to Time  Perhaps not Alice cautiously replied but I know I have to beat time when I learn music  Ah that accounts for it said the Hatter He won t stand beating Now if you only kept on good terms with him he d do almost anything you liked with the clock For instance suppose it were nine o clock in the morning just time to begin lessons you d only have to whisper a hint to Time and round goes the clock in a twinkling Half-past one time for dinner  I only wish it was the March Hare said to itself in a whisper  That would be grand certainly said Alice thoughtfully but then—I shouldn t be hungry for it you know  Not at first perhaps said the Hatter but you could keep it to half-past one as long as you liked  Is that the way you manage Alice asked  The Hatter shook his head mournfully Not I he replied We quarrelled last March—just before he went mad you know— pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare —it was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts and I had to sing  ‘Twinkle twinkle little bat How I wonder what you re at    You know the song perhaps  I ve heard something like it said Alice  It goes on you know the Hatter continued in this way—  ‘Up above the world you fly Like a tea-tray in the sky                     Twinkle twinkle—    Here the Dormouse shook itself and began singing in its sleep Twinkle twinkle twinkle twinkle— and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop  Well I d hardly finished the first verse said the Hatter when the Queen jumped up and bawled out ‘He s murdering the time Off with his head   How dreadfully savage exclaimed Alice  And ever since that the Hatter went on in a mournful tone he won t do a thing I ask It s always six o clock now  A bright idea came into Alice s head Is that the reason so many tea-things are put out here she asked  Yes that s it said the Hatter with a sigh it s always tea-time and we ve no time to wash the things between whiles  Then you keep moving round I suppose said Alice  Exactly so said the Hatter as the things get used up  But what happens when you come to the beginning again Alice ventured to ask  Suppose we change the subject the March Hare interrupted yawning I m getting tired of this I vote the young lady tells us a story  I m afraid I don t know one said Alice rather alarmed at the proposal  Then the Dormouse shall they both cried Wake up Dormouse And they pinched it on both sides at once  The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes I wasn t asleep he said in a hoarse feeble voice I heard every word you fellows were saying  Tell us a story said the March Hare  Yes please do pleaded Alice  And be quick about it added the Hatter or you ll be asleep again before it s done  Once upon a time there were three little sisters the Dormouse began in a great hurry and their names were Elsie Lacie and Tillie and they lived at the bottom of a well—  What did they live on said Alice who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking  They lived on treacle said the Dormouse after thinking a minute or two  They couldn t have done that you know Alice gently remarked they d have been ill  So they were said the Dormouse very ill  Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like but it puzzled her too much so she went on But why did they live at the bottom of a well  Take some more tea the March Hare said to Alice very earnestly  I ve had nothing yet Alice replied in an offended tone so I can t take more  You mean you can t take less said the Hatter it s very easy to take more than nothing  Nobody asked your opinion said Alice  Who s making personal remarks now the Hatter asked triumphantly  Alice did not quite know what to say to this so she helped herself to some tea and bread-and-butter and then turned to the Dormouse and repeated her question Why did they live at the bottom of a well  The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it and then said It was a treacle-well  There s no such thing Alice was beginning very angrily but the Hatter and the March Hare went Sh sh and the Dormouse sulkily remarked If you can t be civil you d better finish the story for yourself  No please go on Alice said very humbly I won t interrupt again I dare say there may be one  One indeed said the Dormouse indignantly However he consented to go on And so these three little sisters—they were learning to draw you know—  What did they draw said Alice quite forgetting her promise  Treacle said the Dormouse without considering at all this time  I want a clean cup interrupted the Hatter let s all move one place on  He moved on as he spoke and the Dormouse followed him the March Hare moved into the Dormouse s place and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the March Hare The Hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change and Alice was a good deal worse off than before as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate  Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again so she began very cautiously But I don t understand Where did they draw the treacle from  You can draw water out of a water-well said the Hatter so I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well—eh stupid  But they were in the well Alice said to the Dormouse not choosing to notice this last remark  Of course they were said the Dormouse —well in  This answer so confused poor Alice that she let the Dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it  They were learning to draw the Dormouse went on yawning and rubbing its eyes for it was getting very sleepy and they drew all manner of things—everything that begins with an M—  Why with an M said Alice  Why not said the March Hare  Alice was silent  The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time and was going off into a doze but on being pinched by the Hatter it woke up again with a little shriek and went on —that begins with an M such as mouse-traps and the moon and memory and muchness—you know you say things are much of a muchness—did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness  Really now you ask me said Alice very much confused I don t think—  Then you shouldn t talk said the Hatter  This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear she got up in great disgust and walked off the Dormouse fell asleep instantly and neither of the others took the least notice of her going though she looked back once or twice half hoping that they would call after her the last time she saw them they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot  At any rate I ll never go there again said Alice as she picked her way through the wood It s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all my life  Just as she said this she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it That s very curious she thought But everything s curious today I think I may as well go in at once And in she went  Once more she found herself in the long hall and close to the little glass table Now I ll manage better this time she said to herself and began by taking the little golden key and unlocking the door that led into the garden Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom she had kept a piece of it in her pocket till she was about a foot high then she walked down the little passage and then—she found herself at last in the beautiful garden among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains     CHAPTER VIII The Queen s Croquet-Ground   A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden the roses growing on it were white but there were three gardeners at it busily painting them red Alice thought this a very curious thing and she went nearer to watch them and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say Look out now Five Don t go splashing paint over me like that  I couldn t help it said Five in a sulky tone Seven jogged my elbow  On which Seven looked up and said That s right Five Always lay the blame on others  You d better not talk said Five I heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded  What for said the one who had spoken first  That s none of your business Two said Seven  Yes it is his business said Five and I ll tell him—it was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions  Seven flung down his brush and had just begun Well of all the unjust things— when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice as she stood watching them and he checked himself suddenly the others looked round also and all of them bowed low  Would you tell me said Alice a little timidly why you are painting those roses  Five and Seven said nothing but looked at Two Two began in a low voice Why the fact is you see Miss this here ought to have been a red rose-tree and we put a white one in by mistake and if the Queen was to find it out we should all have our heads cut off you know So you see Miss we re doing our best afore she comes to— At this moment Five who had been anxiously looking across the garden called out The Queen The Queen and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces There was a sound of many footsteps and Alice looked round eager to see the Queen  First came ten soldiers carrying clubs these were all shaped like the three gardeners oblong and flat with their hands and feet at the corners next the ten courtiers these were ornamented all over with diamonds and walked two and two as the soldiers did After these came the royal children there were ten of them and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand in couples they were all ornamented with hearts Next came the guests mostly Kings and Queens and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit it was talking in a hurried nervous manner smiling at everything that was said and went by without noticing her Then followed the Knave of Hearts carrying the King s crown on a crimson velvet cushion and last of all this grand procession came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS  Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions and besides what would be the use of a procession thought she if people had all to lie down upon their faces so that they couldn t see it So she stood still where she was and waited  When the procession came opposite to Alice they all stopped and looked at her and the Queen said severely Who is this She said it to the Knave of Hearts who only bowed and smiled in reply  Idiot said the Queen tossing her head impatiently and turning to Alice she went on What s your name child  My name is Alice so please your Majesty said Alice very politely but she added to herself Why they re only a pack of cards after all I needn t be afraid of them  And who are these said the Queen pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rose-tree for you see as they were lying on their faces and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack she could not tell whether they were gardeners or soldiers or courtiers or three of her own children  How should I know said Alice surprised at her own courage It s no business of mine  The Queen turned crimson with fury and after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast screamed Off with her head Off—  Nonsense said Alice very loudly and decidedly and the Queen was silent  The King laid his hand upon her arm and timidly said Consider my dear she is only a child  The Queen turned angrily away from him and said to the Knave Turn them over  The Knave did so very carefully with one foot  Get up said the Queen in a shrill loud voice and the three gardeners instantly jumped up and began bowing to the King the Queen the royal children and everybody else  Leave off that screamed the Queen You make me giddy And then turning to the rose-tree she went on What have you been doing here  May it please your Majesty said Two in a very humble tone going down on one knee as he spoke we were trying—  I see said the Queen who had meanwhile been examining the roses Off with their heads and the procession moved on three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners who ran to Alice for protection  You shan t be beheaded said Alice and she put them into a large flower-pot that stood near The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two looking for them and then quietly marched off after the others  Are their heads off shouted the Queen  Their heads are gone if it please your Majesty the soldiers shouted in reply  That s right shouted the Queen Can you play croquet  The soldiers were silent and looked at Alice as the question was evidently meant for her  Yes shouted Alice  Come on then roared the Queen and Alice joined the procession wondering very much what would happen next  It s—it s a very fine day said a timid voice at her side She was walking by the White Rabbit who was peeping anxiously into her face  Very said Alice —where s the Duchess  Hush Hush said the Rabbit in a low hurried tone He looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke and then raised himself upon tiptoe put his mouth close to her ear and whispered She s under sentence of execution  What for said Alice  Did you say ‘What a pity  the Rabbit asked  No I didn t said Alice I don t think it s at all a pity I said ‘What for   She boxed the Queen s ears— the Rabbit began Alice gave a little scream of laughter Oh hush the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone The Queen will hear you You see she came rather late and the Queen said—  Get to your places shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder and people began running about in all directions tumbling up against each other however they got settled down in a minute or two and the game began Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life it was all ridges and furrows the balls were live hedgehogs the mallets live flamingoes and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet to make the arches  The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo she succeeded in getting its body tucked away comfortably enough under her arm with its legs hanging down but generally just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head it would twist itself round and look up in her face with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing and when she had got its head down and was going to begin again it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself and was in the act of crawling away besides all this there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to and as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed  The players all played at once without waiting for turns quarrelling all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting Off with his head or Off with her head about once in a minute  Alice began to feel very uneasy to be sure she had not as yet had any dispute with the Queen but she knew that it might happen any minute and then thought she what would become of me They re dreadfully fond of beheading people here the great wonder is that there s any one left alive  She was looking about for some way of escape and wondering whether she could get away without being seen when she noticed a curious appearance in the air it puzzled her very much at first but after watching it a minute or two she made it out to be a grin and she said to herself It s the Cheshire Cat now I shall have somebody to talk to  How are you getting on said the Cat as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with  Alice waited till the eyes appeared and then nodded It s no use speaking to it she thought till its ears have come or at least one of them In another minute the whole head appeared and then Alice put down her flamingo and began an account of the game feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her The Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight and no more of it appeared  I don t think they play at all fairly Alice began in rather a complaining tone and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can t hear oneself speak—and they don t seem to have any rules in particular at least if there are nobody attends to them—and you ve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive for instance there s the arch I ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground—and I should have croqueted the Queen s hedgehog just now only it ran away when it saw mine coming  How do you like the Queen said the Cat in a low voice  Not at all said Alice she s so extremely— Just then she noticed that the Queen was close behind her listening so she went on —likely to win that it s hardly worth while finishing the game  The Queen smiled and passed on  Who are you talking to said the King going up to Alice and looking at the Cat s head with great curiosity  It s a friend of mine—a Cheshire Cat said Alice allow me to introduce it  I don t like the look of it at all said the King however it may kiss my hand if it likes  I d rather not the Cat remarked  Don t be impertinent said the King and don t look at me like that He got behind Alice as he spoke  A cat may look at a king said Alice I ve read that in some book but I don t remember where  Well it must be removed said the King very decidedly and he called the Queen who was passing at the moment My dear I wish you would have this cat removed  The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties great or small Off with his head she said without even looking round  I ll fetch the executioner myself said the King eagerly and he hurried off  Alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going on as she heard the Queen s voice in the distance screaming with passion She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns and she did not like the look of things at all as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not So she went in search of her hedgehog  The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree  By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back the fight was over and both the hedgehogs were out of sight but it doesn t matter much thought Alice as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground So she tucked it away under her arm that it might not escape again and went back for a little more conversation with her friend  When she got back to the Cheshire Cat she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it there was a dispute going on between the executioner the King and the Queen who were all talking at once while all the rest were quite silent and looked very uncomfortable  The moment Alice appeared she was appealed to by all three to settle the question and they repeated their arguments to her though as they all spoke at once she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said  The executioner s argument was that you couldn t cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from that he had never had to do such a thing before and he wasn t going to begin at his time of life  The King s argument was that anything that had a head could be beheaded and that you weren t to talk nonsense  The Queen s argument was that if something wasn t done about it in less than no time she d have everybody executed all round It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious  Alice could think of nothing else to say but It belongs to the Duchess you d better ask her about it  She s in prison the Queen said to the executioner fetch her here And the executioner went off like an arrow  The Cat s head began fading away the moment he was gone and by the time he had come back with the Duchess it had entirely disappeared so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it while the rest of the party went back to the game     CHAPTER IX The Mock Turtle s Story   You can t think how glad I am to see you again you dear old thing said the Duchess as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice s and they walked off together  Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen  When I m a Duchess she said to herself not in a very hopeful tone though I won t have any pepper in my kitchen at all Soup does very well without—Maybe it s always pepper that makes people hot-tempered she went on very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule and vinegar that makes them sour—and camomile that makes them bitter—and—and barley-sugar and such things that make children sweet-tempered I only wish people knew that then they wouldn t be so stingy about it you know—  She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear You re thinking about something my dear and that makes you forget to talk I can t tell you just now what the moral of that is but I shall remember it in a bit  Perhaps it hasn t one Alice ventured to remark  Tut tut child said the Duchess Everything s got a moral if only you can find it And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice s side as she spoke  Alice did not much like keeping so close to her first because the Duchess was very ugly and secondly because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice s shoulder and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin However she did not like to be rude so she bore it as well as she could  The game s going on rather better now she said by way of keeping up the conversation a little   Tis so said the Duchess and the moral of that is—‘Oh  tis love  tis love that makes the world go round   Somebody said Alice whispered that it s done by everybody minding their own business  Ah well It means much the same thing said the Duchess digging her sharp little chin into Alice s shoulder as she added and the moral of that is—‘Take care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves   How fond she is of finding morals in things Alice thought to herself  I dare say you re wondering why I don t put my arm round your waist the Duchess said after a pause the reason is that I m doubtful about the temper of your flamingo Shall I try the experiment  He might bite Alice cautiously replied not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried  Very true said the Duchess flamingoes and mustard both bite And the moral of that is—‘Birds of a feather flock together   Only mustard isn t a bird Alice remarked  Right as usual said the Duchess what a clear way you have of putting things  It s a mineral I think said Alice  Of course it is said the Duchess who seemed ready to agree to everything that Alice said there s a large mustard-mine near here And the moral of that is—‘The more there is of mine the less there is of yours   Oh I know exclaimed Alice who had not attended to this last remark it s a vegetable It doesn t look like one but it is  I quite agree with you said the Duchess and the moral of that is—‘Be what you would seem to be —or if you d like it put more simply—‘Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise   I think I should understand that better Alice said very politely if I had it written down but I can t quite follow it as you say it  That s nothing to what I could say if I chose the Duchess replied in a pleased tone  Pray don t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that said Alice  Oh don t talk about trouble said the Duchess I make you a present of everything I ve said as yet  A cheap sort of present thought Alice I m glad they don t give birthday presents like that But she did not venture to say it out loud  Thinking again the Duchess asked with another dig of her sharp little chin  I ve a right to think said Alice sharply for she was beginning to feel a little worried  Just about as much right said the Duchess as pigs have to fly and the m—  But here to Alice s great surprise the Duchess s voice died away even in the middle of her favourite word ‘moral  and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble Alice looked up and there stood the Queen in front of them with her arms folded frowning like a thunderstorm  A fine day your Majesty the Duchess began in a low weak voice  Now I give you fair warning shouted the Queen stamping on the ground as she spoke either you or your head must be off and that in about half no time Take your choice  The Duchess took her choice and was gone in a moment  Let s go on with the game the Queen said to Alice and Alice was too much frightened to say a word but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground  The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen s absence and were resting in the shade however the moment they saw her they hurried back to the game the Queen merely remarking that a moment s delay would cost them their lives  All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with the other players and shouting Off with his head or Off with her head Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers who of course had to leave off being arches to do this so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left and all the players except the King the Queen and Alice were in custody and under sentence of execution  Then the Queen left off quite out of breath and said to Alice Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet  No said Alice I don t even know what a Mock Turtle is  It s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from said the Queen  I never saw one or heard of one said Alice  Come on then said the Queen and he shall tell you his history  As they walked off together Alice heard the King say in a low voice to the company generally You are all pardoned Come that s a good thing she said to herself for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered  They very soon came upon a Gryphon lying fast asleep in the sun If you don t know what a Gryphon is look at the picture Up lazy thing said the Queen and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle and to hear his history I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered and she walked off leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon Alice did not quite like the look of the creature but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen so she waited  The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes then it watched the Queen till she was out of sight then it chuckled What fun said the Gryphon half to itself half to Alice  What is the fun said Alice  Why she said the Gryphon It s all her fancy that they never executes nobody you know Come on  Everybody says ‘come on  here thought Alice as she went slowly after it I never was so ordered about in all my life never  They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock and as they came nearer Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break She pitied him deeply What is his sorrow she asked the Gryphon and the Gryphon answered very nearly in the same words as before It s all his fancy that he hasn t got no sorrow you know Come on  So they went up to the Mock Turtle who looked at them with large eyes full of tears but said nothing  This here young lady said the Gryphon she wants for to know your history she do  I ll tell it her said the Mock Turtle in a deep hollow tone sit down both of you and don t speak a word till I ve finished  So they sat down and nobody spoke for some minutes Alice thought to herself I don t see how he can ever finish if he doesn t begin But she waited patiently  Once said the Mock Turtle at last with a deep sigh I was a real Turtle  These words were followed by a very long silence broken only by an occasional exclamation of Hjckrrh from the Gryphon and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle Alice was very nearly getting up and saying Thank you sir for your interesting story but she could not help thinking there must be more to come so she sat still and said nothing  When we were little the Mock Turtle went on at last more calmly though still sobbing a little now and then we went to school in the sea The master was an old Turtle—we used to call him Tortoise—  Why did you call him Tortoise if he wasn t one Alice asked  We called him Tortoise because he taught us said the Mock Turtle angrily really you are very dull  You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question added the Gryphon and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice who felt ready to sink into the earth At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle Drive on old fellow Don t be all day about it and he went on in these words  Yes we went to school in the sea though you mayn t believe it—  I never said I didn t interrupted Alice  You did said the Mock Turtle  Hold your tongue added the Gryphon before Alice could speak again The Mock Turtle went on  We had the best of educations—in fact we went to school every day—  I ve been to a day-school too said Alice you needn t be so proud as all that  With extras asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously  Yes said Alice we learned French and music  And washing said the Mock Turtle  Certainly not said Alice indignantly  Ah then yours wasn t a really good school said the Mock Turtle in a tone of great relief Now at ours they had at the end of the bill ‘French music and washing—extra   You couldn t have wanted it much said Alice living at the bottom of the sea  I couldn t afford to learn it said the Mock Turtle with a sigh I only took the regular course  What was that inquired Alice  Reeling and Writhing of course to begin with the Mock Turtle replied and then the different branches of Arithmetic—Ambition Distraction Uglification and Derision  I never heard of ‘Uglification  Alice ventured to say What is it  The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise What Never heard of uglifying it exclaimed You know what to beautify is I suppose  Yes said Alice doubtfully it means—to—make—anything—prettier  Well then the Gryphon went on if you don t know what to uglify is you are a simpleton  Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it so she turned to the Mock Turtle and said What else had you to learn  Well there was Mystery the Mock Turtle replied counting off the subjects on his flappers —Mystery ancient and modern with Seaography then Drawling—the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel that used to come once a week he taught us Drawling Stretching and Fainting in Coils  What was that like said Alice  Well I can t show it you myself the Mock Turtle said I m too stiff And the Gryphon never learnt it  Hadn t time said the Gryphon I went to the Classics master though He was an old crab he was  I never went to him the Mock Turtle said with a sigh he taught Laughing and Grief they used to say  So he did so he did said the Gryphon sighing in his turn and both creatures hid their faces in their paws  And how many hours a day did you do lessons said Alice in a hurry to change the subject  Ten hours the first day said the Mock Turtle nine the next and so on  What a curious plan exclaimed Alice  That s the reason they re called lessons the Gryphon remarked because they lessen from day to day  This was quite a new idea to Alice and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday  Of course it was said the Mock Turtle  And how did you manage on the twelfth Alice went on eagerly  That s enough about lessons the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone tell her something about the games now     CHAPTER X The Lobster Quadrille   The Mock Turtle sighed deeply and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes He looked at Alice and tried to speak but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice Same as if he had a bone in his throat said the Gryphon and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice and with tears running down his cheeks he went on again—  You may not have lived much under the sea— I haven t said Alice—and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster— Alice began to say I once tasted— but checked herself hastily and said No never —so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is  No indeed said Alice What sort of a dance is it  Why said the Gryphon you first form into a line along the sea-shore—  Two lines cried the Mock Turtle Seals turtles salmon and so on then when you ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way—  That generally takes some time interrupted the Gryphon  —you advance twice—  Each with a lobster as a partner cried the Gryphon  Of course the Mock Turtle said advance twice set to partners—  —change lobsters and retire in same order continued the Gryphon  Then you know the Mock Turtle went on you throw the—  The lobsters shouted the Gryphon with a bound into the air  —as far out to sea as you can—  Swim after them screamed the Gryphon  Turn a somersault in the sea cried the Mock Turtle capering wildly about  Change lobsters again yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice  Back to land again and that s all the first figure said the Mock Turtle suddenly dropping his voice and the two creatures who had been jumping about like mad things all this time sat down again very sadly and quietly and looked at Alice  It must be a very pretty dance said Alice timidly  Would you like to see a little of it said the Mock Turtle  Very much indeed said Alice  Come let s try the first figure said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon We can do without lobsters you know Which shall sing  Oh you sing said the Gryphon I ve forgotten the words  So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close and waving their forepaws to mark the time while the Mock Turtle sang this very slowly and sadly—  Will you walk a little faster said a whiting to a snail There s a porpoise close behind us and he s treading on my tail See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance They are waiting on the shingle—will you come and join the dance Will you won t you will you won t you will you join the dance Will you won t you will you won t you won t you join the dance  You can really have no notion how delightful it will be When they take us up and throw us with the lobsters out to sea But the snail replied Too far too far and gave a look askance— Said he thanked the whiting kindly but he would not join the dance Would not could not would not could not would not join the dance Would not could not would not could not could not join the dance  What matters it how far we go his scaly friend replied There is another shore you know upon the other side The further off from England the nearer is to France— Then turn not pale beloved snail but come and join the dance Will you won t you will you won t you will you join the dance Will you won t you will you won t you won t you join the dance   Thank you it s a very interesting dance to watch said Alice feeling very glad that it was over at last and I do so like that curious song about the whiting  Oh as to the whiting said the Mock Turtle they—you ve seen them of course  Yes said Alice I ve often seen them at dinn— she checked herself hastily  I don t know where Dinn may be said the Mock Turtle but if you ve seen them so often of course you know what they re like  I believe so Alice replied thoughtfully They have their tails in their mouths—and they re all over crumbs  You re wrong about the crumbs said the Mock Turtle crumbs would all wash off in the sea But they have their tails in their mouths and the reason is— here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes—Tell her about the reason and all that he said to the Gryphon  The reason is said the Gryphon that they would go with the lobsters to the dance So they got thrown out to sea So they had to fall a long way So they got their tails fast in their mouths So they couldn t get them out again That s all  Thank you said Alice it s very interesting I never knew so much about a whiting before  I can tell you more than that if you like said the Gryphon Do you know why it s called a whiting  I never thought about it said Alice Why  It does the boots and shoes the Gryphon replied very solemnly  Alice was thoroughly puzzled Does the boots and shoes she repeated in a wondering tone  Why what are your shoes done with said the Gryphon I mean what makes them so shiny  Alice looked down at them and considered a little before she gave her answer They re done with blacking I believe  Boots and shoes under the sea the Gryphon went on in a deep voice are done with a whiting Now you know  And what are they made of Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity  Soles and eels of course the Gryphon replied rather impatiently any shrimp could have told you that  If I d been the whiting said Alice whose thoughts were still running on the song I d have said to the porpoise ‘Keep back please we don t want you with us   They were obliged to have him with them the Mock Turtle said no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise  Wouldn t it really said Alice in a tone of great surprise  Of course not said the Mock Turtle why if a fish came to me and told me he was going a journey I should say ‘With what porpoise   Don t you mean ‘purpose  said Alice  I mean what I say the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone And the Gryphon added Come let s hear some of your adventures  I could tell you my adventures—beginning from this morning said Alice a little timidly but it s no use going back to yesterday because I was a different person then  Explain all that said the Mock Turtle  No no The adventures first said the Gryphon in an impatient tone explanations take such a dreadful time  So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit She was a little nervous about it just at first the two creatures got so close to her one on each side and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide but she gained courage as she went on Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating You are old Father William to the Caterpillar and the words all coming different and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath and said That s very curious  It s all about as curious as it can be said the Gryphon  It all came different the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully I should like to hear her try and repeat something now Tell her to begin He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice  Stand up and repeat ‘ Tis the voice of the sluggard  said the Gryphon  How the creatures order one about and make one repeat lessons thought Alice I might as well be at school at once However she got up and began to repeat it but her head was so full of the Lobster Quadrille that she hardly knew what she was saying and the words came very queer indeed—   Tis the voice of the Lobster I heard him declare You have baked me too brown I must sugar my hair As a duck with its eyelids so he with his nose Trims his belt and his buttons and turns out his toes  [later editions continued as follows When the sands are all dry he is gay as a lark And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark But when the tide rises and sharks are around His voice has a timid and tremulous sound]   That s different from what I used to say when I was a child said the Gryphon  Well I never heard it before said the Mock Turtle but it sounds uncommon nonsense  Alice said nothing she had sat down with her face in her hands wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way again  I should like to have it explained said the Mock Turtle  She can t explain it said the Gryphon hastily Go on with the next verse  But about his toes the Mock Turtle persisted How could he turn them out with his nose you know  It s the first position in dancing Alice said but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing and longed to change the subject  Go on with the next verse the Gryphon repeated impatiently it begins ‘I passed by his garden   Alice did not dare to disobey though she felt sure it would all come wrong and she went on in a trembling voice—  I passed by his garden and marked with one eye How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie—  [later editions continued as follows The Panther took pie-crust and gravy and meat While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat When the pie was all finished the Owl as a boon Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl And concluded the banquet—]   What is the use of repeating all that stuff the Mock Turtle interrupted if you don t explain it as you go on It s by far the most confusing thing I ever heard  Yes I think you d better leave off said the Gryphon and Alice was only too glad to do so  Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille the Gryphon went on Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song  Oh a song please if the Mock Turtle would be so kind Alice replied so eagerly that the Gryphon said in a rather offended tone Hm No accounting for tastes Sing her ‘Turtle Soup  will you old fellow  The Mock Turtle sighed deeply and began in a voice sometimes choked with sobs to sing this—  Beautiful Soup so rich and green Waiting in a hot tureen Who for such dainties would not stoop Soup of the evening beautiful Soup Soup of the evening beautiful Soup     Beau—ootiful Soo—oop     Beau—ootiful Soo—oop Soo—oop of the e—e—evening     Beautiful beautiful Soup  Beautiful Soup Who cares for fish Game or any other dish Who would not give all else for two p ennyworth only of beautiful Soup Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup     Beau—ootiful Soo—oop     Beau—ootiful Soo—oop Soo—oop of the e—e—evening     Beautiful beauti—FUL SOUP   Chorus again cried the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle had just begun to repeat it when a cry of The trial s beginning was heard in the distance  Come on cried the Gryphon and taking Alice by the hand it hurried off without waiting for the end of the song  What trial is it Alice panted as she ran but the Gryphon only answered Come on and ran the faster while more and more faintly came carried on the breeze that followed them the melancholy words—  Soo—oop of the e—e—evening     Beautiful beautiful Soup     CHAPTER XI Who Stole the Tarts   The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived with a great crowd assembled about them—all sorts of little birds and beasts as well as the whole pack of cards the Knave was standing before them in chains with a soldier on each side to guard him and near the King was the White Rabbit with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the other In the very middle of the court was a table with a large dish of tarts upon it they looked so good that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them—I wish they d get the trial done she thought and hand round the refreshments But there seemed to be no chance of this so she began looking at everything about her to pass away the time  Alice had never been in a court of justice before but she had read about them in books and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there That s the judge she said to herself because of his great wig  The judge by the way was the King and as he wore his crown over the wig look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it he did not look at all comfortable and it was certainly not becoming  And that s the jury-box thought Alice and those twelve creatures she was obliged to say creatures you see because some of them were animals and some were birds I suppose they are the jurors She said this last word two or three times over to herself being rather proud of it for she thought and rightly too that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all However jury-men would have done just as well  The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates What are they doing Alice whispered to the Gryphon They can t have anything to put down yet before the trial s begun  They re putting down their names the Gryphon whispered in reply for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial  Stupid things Alice began in a loud indignant voice but she stopped hastily for the White Rabbit cried out Silence in the court and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round to make out who was talking  Alice could see as well as if she were looking over their shoulders that all the jurors were writing down stupid things on their slates and she could even make out that one of them didn t know how to spell stupid and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him A nice muddle their slates ll be in before the trial s over thought Alice  One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked This of course Alice could not stand and she went round the court and got behind him and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away She did it so quickly that the poor little juror it was Bill the Lizard could not make out at all what had become of it so after hunting all about for it he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day and this was of very little use as it left no mark on the slate  Herald read the accusation said the King  On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and then unrolled the parchment scroll and read as follows—  The Queen of Hearts she made some tarts     All on a summer day The Knave of Hearts he stole those tarts     And took them quite away   Consider your verdict the King said to the jury  Not yet not yet the Rabbit hastily interrupted There s a great deal to come before that  Call the first witness said the King and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out First witness  The first witness was the Hatter He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other I beg pardon your Majesty he began for bringing these in but I hadn t quite finished my tea when I was sent for  You ought to have finished said the King When did you begin  The Hatter looked at the March Hare who had followed him into the court arm-in-arm with the Dormouse Fourteenth of March I think it was he said  Fifteenth said the March Hare  Sixteenth added the Dormouse  Write that down the King said to the jury and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates and then added them up and reduced the answer to shillings and pence  Take off your hat the King said to the Hatter  It isn t mine said the Hatter  Stolen the King exclaimed turning to the jury who instantly made a memorandum of the fact  I keep them to sell the Hatter added as an explanation I ve none of my own I m a hatter  Here the Queen put on her spectacles and began staring at the Hatter who turned pale and fidgeted  Give your evidence said the King and don t be nervous or I ll have you executed on the spot  This did not seem to encourage the witness at all he kept shifting from one foot to the other looking uneasily at the Queen and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter  Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was she was beginning to grow larger again and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her  I wish you wouldn t squeeze so said the Dormouse who was sitting next to her I can hardly breathe  I can t help it said Alice very meekly I m growing  You ve no right to grow here said the Dormouse  Don t talk nonsense said Alice more boldly you know you re growing too  Yes but I grow at a reasonable pace said the Dormouse not in that ridiculous fashion And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court  All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter and just as the Dormouse crossed the court she said to one of the officers of the court Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert on which the wretched Hatter trembled so that he shook both his shoes off  Give your evidence the King repeated angrily or I ll have you executed whether you re nervous or not  I m a poor man your Majesty the Hatter began in a trembling voice —and I hadn t begun my tea—not above a week or so—and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin—and the twinkling of the tea—  The twinkling of the what said the King  It began with the tea the Hatter replied  Of course twinkling begins with a T said the King sharply Do you take me for a dunce Go on  I m a poor man the Hatter went on and most things twinkled after that—only the March Hare said—  I didn t the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry  You did said the Hatter  I deny it said the March Hare  He denies it said the King leave out that part  Well at any rate the Dormouse said— the Hatter went on looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too but the Dormouse denied nothing being fast asleep  After that continued the Hatter I cut some more bread-and-butter—  But what did the Dormouse say one of the jury asked  That I can t remember said the Hatter  You must remember remarked the King or I ll have you executed  The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter and went down on one knee I m a poor man your Majesty he began  You re a very poor speaker said the King  Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court As that is rather a hard word I will just explain to you how it was done They had a large canvas bag which tied up at the mouth with strings into this they slipped the guinea-pig head first and then sat upon it  I m glad I ve seen that done thought Alice I ve so often read in the newspapers at the end of trials There was some attempts at applause which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court and I never understood what it meant till now  If that s all you know about it you may stand down continued the King  I can t go no lower said the Hatter I m on the floor as it is  Then you may sit down the King replied  Here the other guinea-pig cheered and was suppressed  Come that finished the guinea-pigs thought Alice Now we shall get on better  I d rather finish my tea said the Hatter with an anxious look at the Queen who was reading the list of singers  You may go said the King and the Hatter hurriedly left the court without even waiting to put his shoes on  —and just take his head off outside the Queen added to one of the officers but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door  Call the next witness said the King  The next witness was the Duchess s cook She carried the pepper-box in her hand and Alice guessed who it was even before she got into the court by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once  Give your evidence said the King  Shan t said the cook  The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit who said in a low voice Your Majesty must cross-examine this witness  Well if I must I must the King said with a melancholy air and after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight he said in a deep voice What are tarts made of  Pepper mostly said the cook  Treacle said a sleepy voice behind her  Collar that Dormouse the Queen shrieked out Behead that Dormouse Turn that Dormouse out of court Suppress him Pinch him Off with his whiskers  For some minutes the whole court was in confusion getting the Dormouse turned out and by the time they had settled down again the cook had disappeared  Never mind said the King with an air of great relief Call the next witness And he added in an undertone to the Queen Really my dear you must cross-examine the next witness It quite makes my forehead ache  Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like —for they haven t got much evidence yet she said to herself Imagine her surprise when the White Rabbit read out at the top of his shrill little voice the name Alice     CHAPTER XII Alice s Evidence   Here cried Alice quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below and there they lay sprawling about reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before  Oh I beg your pardon she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay and began picking them up again as quickly as she could for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box or they would die  The trial cannot proceed said the King in a very grave voice until all the jurymen are back in their proper places—all he repeated with great emphasis looking hard at Alice as he said so  Alice looked at the jury-box and saw that in her haste she had put the Lizard in head downwards and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way being quite unable to move She soon got it out again and put it right not that it signifies much she said to herself I should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other  As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident all except the Lizard who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open gazing up into the roof of the court  What do you know about this business the King said to Alice  Nothing said Alice  Nothing whatever persisted the King  Nothing whatever said Alice  That s very important the King said turning to the jury They were just beginning to write this down on their slates when the White Rabbit interrupted Unimportant your Majesty means of course he said in a very respectful tone but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke  Unimportant of course I meant the King hastily said and went on to himself in an undertone  important—unimportant—unimportant—important— as if he were trying which word sounded best  Some of the jury wrote it down important and some unimportant Alice could see this as she was near enough to look over their slates but it doesn t matter a bit she thought to herself  At this moment the King who had been for some time busily writing in his note-book cackled out Silence and read out from his book Rule Forty-two All persons more than a mile high to leave the court  Everybody looked at Alice  I m not a mile high said Alice  You are said the King  Nearly two miles high added the Queen  Well I shan t go at any rate said Alice besides that s not a regular rule you invented it just now  It s the oldest rule in the book said the King  Then it ought to be Number One said Alice  The King turned pale and shut his note-book hastily Consider your verdict he said to the jury in a low trembling voice  There s more evidence to come yet please your Majesty said the White Rabbit jumping up in a great hurry this paper has just been picked up  What s in it said the Queen  I haven t opened it yet said the White Rabbit but it seems to be a letter written by the prisoner to—to somebody  It must have been that said the King unless it was written to nobody which isn t usual you know  Who is it directed to said one of the jurymen  It isn t directed at all said the White Rabbit in fact there s nothing written on the outside He unfolded the paper as he spoke and added It isn t a letter after all it s a set of verses  Are they in the prisoner s handwriting asked another of the jurymen  No they re not said the White Rabbit and that s the queerest thing about it The jury all looked puzzled  He must have imitated somebody else s hand said the King The jury all brightened up again  Please your Majesty said the Knave I didn t write it and they can t prove I did there s no name signed at the end  If you didn t sign it said the King that only makes the matter worse You must have meant some mischief or else you d have signed your name like an honest man  There was a general clapping of hands at this it was the first really clever thing the King had said that day  That proves his guilt said the Queen  It proves nothing of the sort said Alice Why you don t even know what they re about  Read them said the King  The White Rabbit put on his spectacles Where shall I begin please your Majesty he asked  Begin at the beginning the King said gravely and go on till you come to the end then stop  These were the verses the White Rabbit read—  They told me you had been to her     And mentioned me to him She gave me a good character     But said I could not swim  He sent them word I had not gone     We know it to be true If she should push the matter on     What would become of you  I gave her one they gave him two     You gave us three or more They all returned from him to you     Though they were mine before  If I or she should chance to be     Involved in this affair He trusts to you to set them free     Exactly as we were  My notion was that you had been     Before she had this fit An obstacle that came between     Him and ourselves and it  Don t let him know she liked them best     For this must ever be A secret kept from all the rest     Between yourself and me   That s the most important piece of evidence we ve heard yet said the King rubbing his hands so now let the jury—  If any one of them can explain it said Alice she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn t a bit afraid of interrupting him I ll give him sixpence I don t believe there s an atom of meaning in it  The jury all wrote down on their slates She doesn t believe there s an atom of meaning in it but none of them attempted to explain the paper  If there s no meaning in it said the King that saves a world of trouble you know as we needn t try to find any And yet I don t know he went on spreading out the verses on his knee and looking at them with one eye I seem to see some meaning in them after all —said I could not swim— you can t swim can you he added turning to the Knave  The Knave shook his head sadly Do I look like it he said Which he certainly did not being made entirely of cardboard  All right so far said the King and he went on muttering over the verses to himself ‘We know it to be true—  that s the jury of course—‘I gave her one they gave him two—  why that must be what he did with the tarts you know—  But it goes on ‘they all returned from him to you  said Alice  Why there they are said the King triumphantly pointing to the tarts on the table Nothing can be clearer than that Then again—‘before she had this fit—  you never had fits my dear I think he said to the Queen  Never said the Queen furiously throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger as he found it made no mark but he now hastily began again using the ink that was trickling down his face as long as it lasted  Then the words don t fit you said the King looking round the court with a smile There was a dead silence  It s a pun the King added in an offended tone and everybody laughed Let the jury consider their verdict the King said for about the twentieth time that day  No no said the Queen Sentence first—verdict afterwards  Stuff and nonsense said Alice loudly The idea of having the sentence first  Hold your tongue said the Queen turning purple  I won t said Alice  Off with her head the Queen shouted at the top of her voice Nobody moved  Who cares for you said Alice she had grown to her full size by this time You re nothing but a pack of cards  At this the whole pack rose up into the air and came flying down upon her she gave a little scream half of fright and half of anger and tried to beat them off and found herself lying on the bank with her head in the lap of her sister who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face  Wake up Alice dear said her sister Why what a long sleep you ve had  Oh I ve had such a curious dream said Alice and she told her sister as well as she could remember them all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about and when she had finished her sister kissed her and said It was a curious dream dear certainly but now run in to your tea it s getting late So Alice got up and ran off thinking while she ran as well she might what a wonderful dream it had been   But her sister sat still just as she left her leaning her head on her hand watching the setting sun and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures till she too began dreaming after a fashion and this was her dream—  First she dreamed of little Alice herself and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers—she could hear the very tones of her voice and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyes—and still as she listened or seemed to listen the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister s dream  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool—she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the Duchess s knee while plates and dishes crashed around it—once more the shriek of the Gryphon the squeaking of the Lizard s slate-pencil and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs filled the air mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle  So she sat on with closed eyes and half believed herself in Wonderland though she knew she had but to open them again and all would change to dull reality—the grass would be only rustling in the wind and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds—the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells and the Queen s shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy—and the sneeze of the baby the shriek of the Gryphon and all the other queer noises would change she knew to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard—while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle s heavy sobs  Lastly she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would in the after-time be herself a grown woman and how she would keep through all her riper years the simple and loving heart of her childhood and how she would gather about her other little children and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows and find a pleasure in all their simple joys remembering her own child-life and the happy summer days   '"

       "' CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole   Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, and what is the use of a book, thought Alice without pictures or conversations  So she was considering in her own mind as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid, whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.  There was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, Oh dear Oh dear I shall be late when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.  In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.  The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.  Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed it was labelled ORANGE MARMALADE, but to her great disappointment it was empty she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.  Well thought Alice to herself, after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs How brave they ll all think me at home Why, I wouldn t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house Which was very likely true.  Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end I wonder how many miles I ve fallen by this time she said aloud. I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see that would be four thousand miles down, I think— for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over —yes, that s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I ve got to Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.  Presently she began again. I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth How funny it ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward The Antipathies, I think— she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn t sound at all the right word —but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma am, is this New Zealand or Australia and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy curtseying as you re falling through the air Do you think you could manage it And what an ignorant little girl she ll think me for asking No, it ll never do to ask perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.  Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. Dinah ll miss me very much to-night, I should think Dinah was the cat. I hope they ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear I wish you were down here with me There are no mice in the air, I m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, Do cats eat bats Do cats eat bats and sometimes, Do bats eat cats for, you see, as she couldn t answer either question, it didn t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, Now, Dinah, tell me the truth did you ever eat a bat when suddenly, thump thump down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.  Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment she looked up, but it was all dark overhead before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it s getting She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.  There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.  Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall but, alas either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted  Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway and even if my head would go through, thought poor Alice, it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope I think I could, if I only knew how to begin. For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes this time she found a little bottle on it, which certainly was not here before, said Alice, and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words DRINK ME, beautifully printed on it in large letters.  It was all very well to say Drink me, but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. No, I ll look first, she said, and see whether it s marked ‘poison  or not for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked poison, it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.  However, this bottle was not marked poison, so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast, she very soon finished it off.                                                                                                                   What a curious feeling said Alice I must be shutting up like a telescope.  And so it was indeed she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further she felt a little nervous about this for it might end, you know, said Alice to herself, in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.  After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once but, alas for poor Alice when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.  Come, there s no use in crying like that said Alice to herself, rather sharply I advise you to leave off this minute She generally gave herself very good advice, though she very seldom followed it, and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. But it s no use now, thought poor Alice, to pretend to be two people Why, there s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person  Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words EAT ME were beautifully marked in currants. Well, I ll eat it, said Alice, and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door so either way I ll get into the garden, and I don t care which happens  She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, Which way Which way, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.  So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.                                                                                                                     CHAPTER II. The Pool of Tears   Curiouser and curiouser cried Alice she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English now I m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was Good-bye, feet for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off. Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears I m sure I shan t be able I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you you must manage the best way you can—but I must be kind to them, thought Alice, or perhaps they won t walk the way I want to go Let me see I ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.  And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. They must go by the carrier, she thought and how funny it ll seem, sending presents to one s own feet And how odd the directions will look       Alice s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender, with      Alice s love.  Oh dear, what nonsense I m talking  Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.  Poor Alice It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye but to get through was more hopeless than ever she sat down and began to cry again.  You ought to be ashamed of yourself, said Alice, a great girl like you, she might well say this, to go on crying in this way Stop this moment, I tell you But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.  After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, Oh the Duchess, the Duchess Oh won t she be savage if I ve kept her waiting Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, If you please, sir— The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.  Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking Dear, dear How queer everything is to-day And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I ve been changed in the night Let me think was I the same when I got up this morning I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I m not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I Ah, that s the great puzzle And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.  I m sure I m not Ada, she said, for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn t go in ringlets at all and I m sure I can t be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh she knows such a very little Besides, she s she, and I m I, and—oh dear, how puzzling it all is I ll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is—oh dear I shall never get to twenty at that rate However, the Multiplication Table doesn t signify let s try Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome—no, that s all wrong, I m certain I must have been changed for Mabel I ll try and say ‘How doth the little—  and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do—  How doth the little crocodile     Improve his shining tail, And pour the waters of the Nile     On every golden scale  How cheerfully he seems to grin,     How neatly spread his claws, And welcome little fishes in     With gently smiling jaws   I m sure those are not the right words, said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, I must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh ever so many lessons to learn No, I ve made up my mind about it if I m Mabel, I ll stay down here It ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying ‘Come up again, dear  I shall only look up and say ‘Who am I then Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I ll come up if not, I ll stay down here till I m somebody else —but, oh dear cried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, I do wish they would put their heads down I am so very tired of being all alone here  As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit s little white kid gloves while she was talking. How can I have done that she thought. I must be growing small again. She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.  That was a narrow escape said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence and now for the garden and she ran with all speed back to the little door but, alas the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before, and things are worse than ever, thought the poor child, for I never was so small as this before, never And I declare it s too bad, that it is  As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, and in that case I can go back by railway, she said to herself. Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station. However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.  I wish I hadn t cried so much said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out. I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears That will be a queer thing, to be sure However, everything is queer to-day.  Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.  Would it be of any use, now, thought Alice, to speak to this mouse Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk at any rate, there s no harm in trying. So she began O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brother s Latin Grammar, A mouse—of a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.  Perhaps it doesn t understand English, thought Alice I daresay it s a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror. For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened. So she began again Où est ma chatte which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. Oh, I beg your pardon cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal s feelings. I quite forgot you didn t like cats.  Not like cats cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. Would you like cats if you were me  Well, perhaps not, said Alice in a soothing tone don t be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah I think you d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet thing, Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool, and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse—and she s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your pardon cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. We won t talk about her any more if you d rather not.  We indeed cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his tail. As if I would talk on such a subject Our family always hated cats nasty, low, vulgar things Don t let me hear the name again  I won t indeed said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation. Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair And it ll fetch things when you throw them, and it ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things—I can t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it s so useful, it s worth a hundred pounds He says it kills all the rats and—oh dear cried Alice in a sorrowful tone, I m afraid I ve offended it again For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.  So she called softly after it, Mouse dear Do come back again, and we won t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don t like them When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her its face was quite pale with passion, Alice thought, and it said in a low trembling voice, Let us get to the shore, and then I ll tell you my history, and you ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.  It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.     CHAPTER III. A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale   They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.  The first question of course was, how to get dry again they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, I am older than you, and must know better and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said.  At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, Sit down, all of you, and listen to me I ll soon make you dry enough They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.  Ahem said the Mouse with an important air, are you all ready This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please ‘William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria—   Ugh said the Lory, with a shiver.  I beg your pardon said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely Did you speak  Not I said the Lory hastily.  I thought you did, said the Mouse. —I proceed. ‘Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable—   Found what said the Duck.  Found it, the Mouse replied rather crossly of course you know what ‘it  means.  I know what ‘it  means well enough, when I find a thing, said the Duck it s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the archbishop find  The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, ‘—found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. William s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his Normans—  How are you getting on now, my dear it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.  As wet as ever, said Alice in a melancholy tone it doesn t seem to dry me at all.  In that case, said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, I move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies—  Speak English said the Eaglet. I don t know the meaning of half those long words, and, what s more, I don t believe you do either And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile some of the other birds tittered audibly.  What I was going to say, said the Dodo in an offended tone, was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.  What is a Caucus-race said Alice not that she wanted much to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.  Why, said the Dodo, the best way to explain it is to do it. And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.  First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, the exact shape doesn t matter, it said, and then all the party were placed along the course, here and there. There was no One, two, three, and away, but they began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out The race is over and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, But who has won  This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him, while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said, Everybody has won, and all must have prizes.  But who is to give the prizes quite a chorus of voices asked.  Why, she, of course, said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused way, Prizes Prizes  Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, luckily the salt water had not got into it, and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one a-piece, all round.  But she must have a prize herself, you know, said the Mouse.  Of course, the Dodo replied very gravely. What else have you got in your pocket he went on, turning to Alice.  Only a thimble, said Alice sadly.  Hand it over here, said the Dodo.  Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble, saying We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.  Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh and, as she could not think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could.  The next thing was to eat the comfits this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.  You promised to tell me your history, you know, said Alice, and why it is you hate—C and D, she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again.  Mine is a long and a sad tale said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and sighing.  It is a long tail, certainly, said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse s tail but why do you call it sad And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this—           Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, ‘Let us both          go to law I will prosecute you.—Come, I ll take no          denial We must have a trial For really this morning I ve          nothing to do.  Said the mouse to the cur, ‘Such a trial, dear          sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.           ‘I ll be judge, I ll be jury,  Said cunning old Fury ‘I ll          try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.   You are not attending said the Mouse to Alice severely. What are you thinking of  I beg your pardon, said Alice very humbly you had got to the fifth bend, I think  I had not cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.  A knot said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about her. Oh, do let me help to undo it  I shall do nothing of the sort, said the Mouse, getting up and walking away. You insult me by talking such nonsense  I didn t mean it pleaded poor Alice. But you re so easily offended, you know  The Mouse only growled in reply.  Please come back and finish your story Alice called after it and the others all joined in chorus, Yes, please do but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.  What a pity it wouldn t stay sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite out of sight and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter Ah, my dear Let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper Hold your tongue, Ma said the young Crab, a little snappishly. You re enough to try the patience of an oyster  I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do said Alice aloud, addressing nobody in particular. She d soon fetch it back  And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question said the Lory.  Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet Dinah s our cat. And she s such a capital one for catching mice you can t think And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds Why, she ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it  This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off at once one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, I really must be getting home the night-air doesn t suit my throat and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children, Come away, my dears It s high time you were all in bed On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.  I wish I hadn t mentioned Dinah she said to herself in a melancholy tone. Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I m sure she s the best cat in the world Oh, my dear Dinah I wonder if I shall ever see you any more And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story.     CHAPTER IV. The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill   It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something and she heard it muttering to itself The Duchess The Duchess Oh my dear paws Oh my fur and whiskers She ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets Where can I have dropped them, I wonder Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely.  Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, Why, Mary Ann, what are you doing out here Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan Quick, now And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made.  He took me for his housemaid, she said to herself as she ran. How surprised he ll be when he finds out who I am But I d better take him his fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them. As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name W. RABBIT, engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves.  How queer it seems, Alice said to herself, to be going messages for a rabbit I suppose Dinah ll be sending me on messages next And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen ‘Miss Alice Come here directly, and get ready for your walk  ‘Coming in a minute, nurse But I ve got to see that the mouse doesn t get out.  Only I don t think, Alice went on, that they d let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that  By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it as she had hoped a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time with the words DRINK ME, but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. I know something interesting is sure to happen, she said to herself, whenever I eat or drink anything so I ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it ll make me grow large again, for really I m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing  It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself That s quite enough—I hope I shan t grow any more—As it is, I can t get out at the door—I do wish I hadn t drunk quite so much  Alas it was too late to wish that She went on growing, and growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor in another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself Now I can do no more, whatever happens. What will become of me  Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no larger still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.  It was much pleasanter at home, thought poor Alice, when one wasn t always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and yet—it s rather curious, you know, this sort of life I do wonder what can have happened to me When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought And when I grow up, I ll write one—but I m grown up now, she added in a sorrowful tone at least there s no room to grow up any more here.  But then, thought Alice, shall I never get any older than I am now That ll be a comfort, one way—never to be an old woman—but then—always to have lessons to learn Oh, I shouldn t like that  Oh, you foolish Alice she answered herself. How can you learn lessons in here Why, there s hardly room for you, and no room at all for any lesson-books  And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making quite a conversation of it altogether but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.  Mary Ann Mary Ann said the voice. Fetch me my gloves this moment Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.  Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice s elbow was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself Then I ll go round and get in at the window.  That you won t thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.  Next came an angry voice—the Rabbit s—Pat Pat Where are you And then a voice she had never heard before, Sure then I m here Digging for apples, yer honour  Digging for apples, indeed said the Rabbit angrily. Here Come and help me out of this Sounds of more broken glass.  Now tell me, Pat, what s that in the window  Sure, it s an arm, yer honour He pronounced it arrum.  An arm, you goose Who ever saw one that size Why, it fills the whole window  Sure, it does, yer honour but it s an arm for all that.  Well, it s got no business there, at any rate go and take it away  There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers now and then such as, Sure, I don t like it, yer honour, at all, at all Do as I tell you, you coward and at last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were two little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. What a number of cucumber-frames there must be thought Alice. I wonder what they ll do next As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they could I m sure I don t want to stay in here any longer  She waited for some time without hearing anything more at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking together she made out the words Where s the other ladder—Why, I hadn t to bring but one Bill s got the other—Bill fetch it here, lad—Here, put  em up at this corner—No, tie  em together first—they don t reach half high enough yet—Oh they ll do well enough don t be particular—Here, Bill catch hold of this rope—Will the roof bear—Mind that loose slate—Oh, it s coming down Heads below a loud crash—Now, who did that—It was Bill, I fancy—Who s to go down the chimney—Nay, I shan t You do it—That I won t, then—Bill s to go down—Here, Bill the master says you re to go down the chimney  Oh So Bill s got to come down the chimney, has he said Alice to herself. Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill I wouldn t be in Bill s place for a good deal this fireplace is narrow, to be sure but I think I can kick a little  She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till she heard a little animal she couldn t guess of what sort it was scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her then, saying to herself This is Bill, she gave one sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.  The first thing she heard was a general chorus of There goes Bill then the Rabbit s voice along—Catch him, you by the hedge then silence, and then another confusion of voices—Hold up his head—Brandy now—Don t choke him—How was it, old fellow What happened to you Tell us all about it  Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, That s Bill, thought Alice, Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye I m better now—but I m a deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket  So you did, old fellow said the others.  We must burn the house down said the Rabbit s voice and Alice called out as loud as she could, If you do, I ll set Dinah at you  There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, I wonder what they will do next If they had any sense, they d take the roof off. After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, A barrowful will do, to begin with.  A barrowful of what thought Alice but she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face. I ll put a stop to this, she said to herself, and shouted out, You d better not do that again which produced another dead silence.  Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her head. If I eat one of these cakes, she thought, it s sure to make some change in my size and as it can t possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I suppose.  So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a thick wood.  The first thing I ve got to do, said Alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, is to grow to my right size again and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be the best plan.  It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry.  An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. Poor little thing said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.  Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run over and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.  This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till the puppy s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.  And yet what a dear little puppy it was said Alice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if I d only been the right size to do it Oh dear I d nearly forgotten that I ve got to grow up again Let me see—how is it to be managed I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other but the great question is, what  The great question certainly was, what Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.  She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.     CHAPTER V. Advice from a Caterpillar   The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.  Who are you said the Caterpillar.  This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.  What do you mean by that said the Caterpillar sternly. Explain yourself  I can t explain myself, I m afraid, sir, said Alice, because I m not myself, you see.  I don t see, said the Caterpillar.  I m afraid I can t put it more clearly, Alice replied very politely, for I can t understand it myself to begin with and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.  It isn t, said the Caterpillar.  Well, perhaps you haven t found it so yet, said Alice but when you have to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you ll feel it a little queer, won t you  Not a bit, said the Caterpillar.  Well, perhaps your feelings may be different, said Alice all I know is, it would feel very queer to me.  You said the Caterpillar contemptuously. Who are you  Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar s making such very short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, I think, you ought to tell me who you are, first.  Why said the Caterpillar.  Here was another puzzling question and as Alice could not think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.  Come back the Caterpillar called after her. I ve something important to say  This sounded promising, certainly Alice turned and came back again.  Keep your temper, said the Caterpillar.  Is that all said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could.  No, said the Caterpillar.  Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, So you think you re changed, do you  I m afraid I am, sir, said Alice I can t remember things as I used—and I don t keep the same size for ten minutes together  Can t remember what things said the Caterpillar.  Well, I ve tried to say How doth the little busy bee, but it all came different Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.  Repeat, You are old, Father William,  said the Caterpillar.  Alice folded her hands, and began—  You are old, Father William, the young man said,     And your hair has become very white And yet you incessantly stand on your head—     Do you think, at your age, it is right  In my youth, Father William replied to his son,     I feared it might injure the brain But, now that I m perfectly sure I have none,     Why, I do it again and again.  You are old, said the youth, as I mentioned before,     And have grown most uncommonly fat Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—     Pray, what is the reason of that  In my youth, said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,     I kept all my limbs very supple By the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—     Allow me to sell you a couple  You are old, said the youth, and your jaws are too weak     For anything tougher than suet Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak—     Pray, how did you manage to do it  In my youth, said his father, I took to the law,     And argued each case with my wife And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,     Has lasted the rest of my life.  You are old, said the youth, one would hardly suppose     That your eye was as steady as ever Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—     What made you so awfully clever  I have answered three questions, and that is enough,     Said his father don t give yourself airs Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff     Be off, or I ll kick you down stairs   That is not said right, said the Caterpillar.  Not quite right, I m afraid, said Alice, timidly some of the words have got altered.  It is wrong from beginning to end, said the Caterpillar decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.  The Caterpillar was the first to speak.  What size do you want to be it asked.  Oh, I m not particular as to size, Alice hastily replied only one doesn t like changing so often, you know.  I don t know, said the Caterpillar.  Alice said nothing she had never been so much contradicted in her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.  Are you content now said the Caterpillar.  Well, I should like to be a little larger, sir, if you wouldn t mind, said Alice three inches is such a wretched height to be.  It is a very good height indeed said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke it was exactly three inches high.  But I m not used to it pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she thought of herself, I wish the creatures wouldn t be so easily offended  You ll get used to it in time, said the Caterpillar and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.  This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went, One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.  One side of what The other side of what thought Alice to herself.  Of the mushroom, said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud and in another moment it was out of sight.  Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it and as it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.  And now which is which she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin it had struck her foot  She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her mouth but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.                                                                                                                   Come, my head s free at last said Alice in a tone of delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found all she could see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her.  What can all that green stuff be said Alice. And where have my shoulders got to And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can t see you She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.  As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating her violently with its wings.  Serpent screamed the Pigeon.  I m not a serpent said Alice indignantly. Let me alone  Serpent, I say again repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, I ve tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them  I haven t the least idea what you re talking about, said Alice.  I ve tried the roots of trees, and I ve tried banks, and I ve tried hedges, the Pigeon went on, without attending to her but those serpents There s no pleasing them  Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.  As if it wasn t trouble enough hatching the eggs, said the Pigeon but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day Why, I haven t had a wink of sleep these three weeks  I m very sorry you ve been annoyed, said Alice, who was beginning to see its meaning.  And just as I d taken the highest tree in the wood, continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky Ugh, Serpent  But I m not a serpent, I tell you said Alice. I m a—I m a—  Well What are you said the Pigeon. I can see you re trying to invent something  I—I m a little girl, said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.  A likely story indeed said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt. I ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never one with such a neck as that No, no You re a serpent and there s no use denying it. I suppose you ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg  I have tasted eggs, certainly, said Alice, who was a very truthful child but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.  I don t believe it, said the Pigeon but if they do, why then they re a kind of serpent, that s all I can say.  This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, You re looking for eggs, I know that well enough and what does it matter to me whether you re a little girl or a serpent  It matters a good deal to me, said Alice hastily but I m not looking for eggs, as it happens and if I was, I shouldn t want yours I don t like them raw.  Well, be off, then said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.  It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. Come, there s half my plan done now How puzzling all these changes are I m never sure what I m going to be, from one minute to another However, I ve got back to my right size the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how is that to be done, I wonder As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high. Whoever lives there, thought Alice, it ll never do to come upon them this size why, I should frighten them out of their wits So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.     CHAPTER VI. Pig and Pepper   For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood—she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a fish—and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a frog and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.  The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play croquet. The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the words a little, From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.  Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.  Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her and when she next peeped out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.  Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.  There s no sort of use in knocking, said the Footman, and that for two reasons. First, because I m on the same side of the door as you are secondly, because they re making such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you. And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within—a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.  Please, then, said Alice, how am I to get in  There might be some sense in your knocking, the Footman went on without attending to her, if we had the door between us. For instance, if you were inside, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know. He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. But perhaps he can t help it, she said to herself his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head. But at any rate he might answer questions.—How am I to get in she repeated, aloud.  I shall sit here, the Footman remarked, till tomorrow—  At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came skimming out, straight at the Footman s head it just grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.  —or next day, maybe, the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly as if nothing had happened.  How am I to get in asked Alice again, in a louder tone.  Are you to get in at all said the Footman. That s the first question, you know.  It was, no doubt only Alice did not like to be told so. It s really dreadful, she muttered to herself, the way all the creatures argue. It s enough to drive one crazy  The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark, with variations. I shall sit here, he said, on and off, for days and days.  But what am I to do said Alice.  Anything you like, said the Footman, and began whistling.  Oh, there s no use in talking to him, said Alice desperately he s perfectly idiotic And she opened the door and went in.  The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the other the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.  There s certainly too much pepper in that soup Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing.  There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment s pause. The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.  Please would you tell me, said Alice, a little timidly, for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, why your cat grins like that  It s a Cheshire cat, said the Duchess, and that s why. Pig  She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again—  I didn t know that Cheshire cats always grinned in fact, I didn t know that cats could grin.  They all can, said the Duchess and most of  em do.  I don t know of any that do, Alice said very politely, feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.  You don t know much, said the Duchess and that s a fact.  Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first then followed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her and the baby was howling so much already, that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.  Oh, please mind what you re doing cried Alice, jumping up and down in an agony of terror. Oh, there goes his precious nose as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.  If everybody minded their own business, the Duchess said in a hoarse growl, the world would go round a deal faster than it does.  Which would not be an advantage, said Alice, who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. Just think of what work it would make with the day and night You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis—  Talking of axes, said the Duchess, chop off her head  Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take the hint but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to be listening, so she went on again Twenty-four hours, I think or is it twelve I—  Oh, don t bother me, said the Duchess I never could abide figures And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line  Speak roughly to your little boy,     And beat him when he sneezes He only does it to annoy,     Because he knows it teases.   CHORUS. In which the cook and the baby joined   Wow wow wow   While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words—  I speak severely to my boy,     I beat him when he sneezes For he can thoroughly enjoy     The pepper when he pleases   CHORUS.   Wow wow wow   Here you may nurse it a bit, if you like the Duchess said to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen, and she hurried out of the room. The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.  Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, just like a star-fish, thought Alice. The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.  As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself, she carried it out into the open air. If I don t take this child away with me, thought Alice, they re sure to kill it in a day or two wouldn t it be murder to leave it behind She said the last words out loud, and the little thing grunted in reply it had left off sneezing by this time. Don t grunt, said Alice that s not at all a proper way of expressing yourself.  The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had a very turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at all. But perhaps it was only sobbing, she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.  No, there were no tears. If you re going to turn into a pig, my dear, said Alice, seriously, I ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind now The poor little thing sobbed again or grunted, it was impossible to say which, and they went on for some while in silence.  Alice was just beginning to think to herself, Now, what am I to do with this creature when I get it home when it grunted again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could be no mistake about it it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.  So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood. If it had grown up, she said to herself, it would have made a dreadfully ugly child but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think. And she began thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying to herself, if one only knew the right way to change them— when she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.  The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she thought still it had very long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.  Cheshire Puss, she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know whether it would like the name however, it only grinned a little wider. Come, it s pleased so far, thought Alice, and she went on. Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here  That depends a good deal on where you want to get to, said the Cat.  I don t much care where— said Alice.  Then it doesn t matter which way you go, said the Cat.  —so long as I get somewhere, Alice added as an explanation.  Oh, you re sure to do that, said the Cat, if you only walk long enough.  Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question. What sort of people live about here  In that direction, the Cat said, waving its right paw round, lives a Hatter and in that direction, waving the other paw, lives a March Hare. Visit either you like they re both mad.  But I don t want to go among mad people, Alice remarked.  Oh, you can t help that, said the Cat we re all mad here. I m mad. You re mad.  How do you know I m mad said Alice.  You must be, said the Cat, or you wouldn t have come here.  Alice didn t think that proved it at all however, she went on And how do you know that you re mad  To begin with, said the Cat, a dog s not mad. You grant that  I suppose so, said Alice.  Well, then, the Cat went on, you see, a dog growls when it s angry, and wags its tail when it s pleased. Now I growl when I m pleased, and wag my tail when I m angry. Therefore I m mad.  I call it purring, not growling, said Alice.  Call it what you like, said the Cat. Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day  I should like it very much, said Alice, but I haven t been invited yet.  You ll see me there, said the Cat, and vanished.  Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.  By-the-bye, what became of the baby said the Cat. I d nearly forgotten to ask.  It turned into a pig, Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back in a natural way.  I thought it would, said the Cat, and vanished again.  Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live. I ve seen hatters before, she said to herself the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won t be raving mad—at least not so mad as it was in March. As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a branch of a tree.  Did you say pig, or fig said the Cat.  I said pig, replied Alice and I wish you wouldn t keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly you make one quite giddy.  All right, said the Cat and this time it vanished quite slowly, beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.  Well I ve often seen a cat without a grin, thought Alice but a grin without a cat It s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life  She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare she thought it must be the right house, because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high even then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself Suppose it should be raving mad after all I almost wish I d gone to see the Hatter instead     CHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-Party   There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse, thought Alice only, as it s asleep, I suppose it doesn t mind.  The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it No room No room they cried out when they saw Alice coming. There s plenty of room said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.  Have some wine, the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.  Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. I don t see any wine, she remarked.  There isn t any, said the March Hare.  Then it wasn t very civil of you to offer it, said Alice angrily.  It wasn t very civil of you to sit down without being invited, said the March Hare.  I didn t know it was your table, said Alice it s laid for a great many more than three.  Your hair wants cutting, said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.  You should learn not to make personal remarks, Alice said with some severity it s very rude.  The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all he said was, Why is a raven like a writing-desk  Come, we shall have some fun now thought Alice. I m glad they ve begun asking riddles.—I believe I can guess that, she added aloud.  Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it said the March Hare.  Exactly so, said Alice.  Then you should say what you mean, the March Hare went on.  I do, Alice hastily replied at least—at least I mean what I say—that s the same thing, you know.  Not the same thing a bit said the Hatter. You might just as well say that ‘I see what I eat  is the same thing as ‘I eat what I see   You might just as well say, added the March Hare, that ‘I like what I get  is the same thing as ‘I get what I like   You might just as well say, added the Dormouse, who seemed to be talking in his sleep, that ‘I breathe when I sleep  is the same thing as ‘I sleep when I breathe   It is the same thing with you, said the Hatter, and here the conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks, which wasn t much.  The Hatter was the first to break the silence. What day of the month is it he said, turning to Alice he had taken his watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.  Alice considered a little, and then said The fourth.  Two days wrong sighed the Hatter. I told you butter wouldn t suit the works he added looking angrily at the March Hare.  It was the best butter, the March Hare meekly replied.  Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well, the Hatter grumbled you shouldn t have put it in with the bread-knife.  The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily then he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, It was the best butter, you know.  Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. What a funny watch she remarked. It tells the day of the month, and doesn t tell what o clock it is  Why should it muttered the Hatter. Does your watch tell you what year it is  Of course not, Alice replied very readily but that s because it stays the same year for such a long time together.  Which is just the case with mine, said the Hatter.  Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter s remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. I don t quite understand you, she said, as politely as she could.  The Dormouse is asleep again, said the Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose.  The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its eyes, Of course, of course just what I was going to remark myself.  Have you guessed the riddle yet the Hatter said, turning to Alice again.  No, I give it up, Alice replied what s the answer  I haven t the slightest idea, said the Hatter.  Nor I, said the March Hare.  Alice sighed wearily. I think you might do something better with the time, she said, than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.  If you knew Time as well as I do, said the Hatter, you wouldn t talk about wasting it. It s him.  I don t know what you mean, said Alice.  Of course you don t the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously. I dare say you never even spoke to Time  Perhaps not, Alice cautiously replied but I know I have to beat time when I learn music.  Ah that accounts for it, said the Hatter. He won t stand beating. Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he d do almost anything you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons you d only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling Half-past one, time for dinner  I only wish it was, the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.  That would be grand, certainly, said Alice thoughtfully but then—I shouldn t be hungry for it, you know.  Not at first, perhaps, said the Hatter but you could keep it to half-past one as long as you liked.  Is that the way you manage Alice asked.  The Hatter shook his head mournfully. Not I he replied. We quarrelled last March—just before he went mad, you know— pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare, —it was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing  ‘Twinkle, twinkle, little bat How I wonder what you re at    You know the song, perhaps  I ve heard something like it, said Alice.  It goes on, you know, the Hatter continued, in this way—  ‘Up above the world you fly, Like a tea-tray in the sky.                     Twinkle, twinkle—    Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle— and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop.  Well, I d hardly finished the first verse, said the Hatter, when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, ‘He s murdering the time Off with his head   How dreadfully savage exclaimed Alice.  And ever since that, the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, he won t do a thing I ask It s always six o clock now.  A bright idea came into Alice s head. Is that the reason so many tea-things are put out here she asked.  Yes, that s it, said the Hatter with a sigh it s always tea-time, and we ve no time to wash the things between whiles.  Then you keep moving round, I suppose said Alice.  Exactly so, said the Hatter as the things get used up.  But what happens when you come to the beginning again Alice ventured to ask.  Suppose we change the subject, the March Hare interrupted, yawning. I m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.  I m afraid I don t know one, said Alice, rather alarmed at the proposal.  Then the Dormouse shall they both cried. Wake up, Dormouse And they pinched it on both sides at once.  The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. I wasn t asleep, he said in a hoarse, feeble voice I heard every word you fellows were saying.  Tell us a story said the March Hare.  Yes, please do pleaded Alice.  And be quick about it, added the Hatter, or you ll be asleep again before it s done.  Once upon a time there were three little sisters, the Dormouse began in a great hurry and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie and they lived at the bottom of a well—  What did they live on said Alice, who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking.  They lived on treacle, said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or two.  They couldn t have done that, you know, Alice gently remarked they d have been ill.  So they were, said the Dormouse very ill.  Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on But why did they live at the bottom of a well  Take some more tea, the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.  I ve had nothing yet, Alice replied in an offended tone, so I can t take more.  You mean you can t take less, said the Hatter it s very easy to take more than nothing.  Nobody asked your opinion, said Alice.  Who s making personal remarks now the Hatter asked triumphantly.  Alice did not quite know what to say to this so she helped herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and repeated her question. Why did they live at the bottom of a well  The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then said, It was a treacle-well.  There s no such thing Alice was beginning very angrily, but the Hatter and the March Hare went Sh sh and the Dormouse sulkily remarked, If you can t be civil, you d better finish the story for yourself.  No, please go on Alice said very humbly I won t interrupt again. I dare say there may be one.  One, indeed said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to go on. And so these three little sisters—they were learning to draw, you know—  What did they draw said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.  Treacle, said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.  I want a clean cup, interrupted the Hatter let s all move one place on.  He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him the March Hare moved into the Dormouse s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change and Alice was a good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.  Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very cautiously But I don t understand. Where did they draw the treacle from  You can draw water out of a water-well, said the Hatter so I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well—eh, stupid  But they were in the well, Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to notice this last remark.  Of course they were, said the Dormouse —well in.  This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it.  They were learning to draw, the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy and they drew all manner of things—everything that begins with an M—  Why with an M said Alice.  Why not said the March Hare.  Alice was silent.  The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a doze but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a little shriek, and went on —that begins with an M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness—you know you say things are much of a muchness—did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness  Really, now you ask me, said Alice, very much confused, I don t think—  Then you shouldn t talk, said the Hatter.  This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear she got up in great disgust, and walked off the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.  At any rate I ll never go there again said Alice as she picked her way through the wood. It s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all my life  Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it. That s very curious she thought. But everything s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once. And in she went.  Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little glass table. Now, I ll manage better this time, she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom she had kept a piece of it in her pocket till she was about a foot high then she walked down the little passage and then—she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.     CHAPTER VIII. The Queen s Croquet-Ground   A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden the roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say, Look out now, Five Don t go splashing paint over me like that  I couldn t help it, said Five, in a sulky tone Seven jogged my elbow.  On which Seven looked up and said, That s right, Five Always lay the blame on others  You d better not talk said Five. I heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded  What for said the one who had spoken first.  That s none of your business, Two said Seven.  Yes, it is his business said Five, and I ll tell him—it was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.  Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun Well, of all the unjust things— when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly the others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.  Would you tell me, said Alice, a little timidly, why you are painting those roses  Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low voice, Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a red rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we re doing our best, afore she comes, to— At this moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out The Queen The Queen and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.  First came ten soldiers carrying clubs these were all shaped like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners next the ten courtiers these were ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came the royal children there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King s crown on a crimson velvet cushion and, last of all this grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.  Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions and besides, what would be the use of a procession, thought she, if people had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn t see it So she stood still where she was, and waited.  When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said severely Who is this She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.  Idiot said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently and, turning to Alice, she went on, What s your name, child  My name is Alice, so please your Majesty, said Alice very politely but she added, to herself, Why, they re only a pack of cards, after all. I needn t be afraid of them  And who are these said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rose-tree for, you see, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children.  How should I know said Alice, surprised at her own courage. It s no business of mine.  The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast, screamed Off with her head Off—  Nonsense said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was silent.  The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said Consider, my dear she is only a child  The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave Turn them over  The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.  Get up said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.  Leave off that screamed the Queen. You make me giddy. And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, What have you been doing here  May it please your Majesty, said Two, in a very humble tone, going down on one knee as he spoke, we were trying—  I see said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses. Off with their heads and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.  You shan t be beheaded said Alice, and she put them into a large flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the others.  Are their heads off shouted the Queen.  Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty the soldiers shouted in reply.  That s right shouted the Queen. Can you play croquet  The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was evidently meant for her.  Yes shouted Alice.  Come on, then roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession, wondering very much what would happen next.  It s—it s a very fine day said a timid voice at her side. She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.  Very, said Alice —where s the Duchess  Hush Hush said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered She s under sentence of execution.  What for said Alice.  Did you say ‘What a pity  the Rabbit asked.  No, I didn t, said Alice I don t think it s at all a pity. I said ‘What for   She boxed the Queen s ears— the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little scream of laughter. Oh, hush the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone. The Queen will hear you You see, she came rather late, and the Queen said—  Get to your places shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each other however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life it was all ridges and furrows the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.  The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it would twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away besides all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.  The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and shouting Off with his head or Off with her head about once in a minute.  Alice began to feel very uneasy to be sure, she had not as yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute, and then, thought she, what would become of me They re dreadfully fond of beheading people here the great wonder is, that there s any one left alive  She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself It s the Cheshire Cat now I shall have somebody to talk to.  How are you getting on said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with.  Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. It s no use speaking to it, she thought, till its ears have come, or at least one of them. In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.  I don t think they play at all fairly, Alice began, in rather a complaining tone, and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can t hear oneself speak—and they don t seem to have any rules in particular at least, if there are, nobody attends to them—and you ve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive for instance, there s the arch I ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground—and I should have croqueted the Queen s hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it saw mine coming  How do you like the Queen said the Cat in a low voice.  Not at all, said Alice she s so extremely— Just then she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening so she went on, —likely to win, that it s hardly worth while finishing the game.  The Queen smiled and passed on.  Who are you talking to said the King, going up to Alice, and looking at the Cat s head with great curiosity.  It s a friend of mine—a Cheshire Cat, said Alice allow me to introduce it.  I don t like the look of it at all, said the King however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.  I d rather not, the Cat remarked.  Don t be impertinent, said the King, and don t look at me like that He got behind Alice as he spoke.  A cat may look at a king, said Alice. I ve read that in some book, but I don t remember where.  Well, it must be removed, said the King very decidedly, and he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, My dear I wish you would have this cat removed  The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small. Off with his head she said, without even looking round.  I ll fetch the executioner myself, said the King eagerly, and he hurried off.  Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going on, as she heard the Queen s voice in the distance, screaming with passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.  The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.  By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight but it doesn t matter much, thought Alice, as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground. So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her friend.  When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it there was a dispute going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.  The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said.  The executioner s argument was, that you couldn t cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from that he had never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn t going to begin at his time of life.  The King s argument was, that anything that had a head could be beheaded, and that you weren t to talk nonsense.  The Queen s argument was, that if something wasn t done about it in less than no time she d have everybody executed, all round. It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.  Alice could think of nothing else to say but It belongs to the Duchess you d better ask her about it.  She s in prison, the Queen said to the executioner fetch her here. And the executioner went off like an arrow.  The Cat s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.     CHAPTER IX. The Mock Turtle s Story   You can t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice s, and they walked off together.  Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen.  When I m a Duchess, she said to herself, not in a very hopeful tone though, I won t have any pepper in my kitchen at all. Soup does very well without—Maybe it s always pepper that makes people hot-tempered, she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule, and vinegar that makes them sour—and camomile that makes them bitter—and—and barley-sugar and such things that make children sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew that then they wouldn t be so stingy about it, you know—  She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. You re thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can t tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in a bit.  Perhaps it hasn t one, Alice ventured to remark.  Tut, tut, child said the Duchess. Everything s got a moral, if only you can find it. And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice s side as she spoke.  Alice did not much like keeping so close to her first, because the Duchess was very ugly and secondly, because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice s shoulder, and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.  The game s going on rather better now, she said, by way of keeping up the conversation a little.   Tis so, said the Duchess and the moral of that is—‘Oh,  tis love,  tis love, that makes the world go round   Somebody said, Alice whispered, that it s done by everybody minding their own business  Ah, well It means much the same thing, said the Duchess, digging her sharp little chin into Alice s shoulder as she added, and the moral of that is—‘Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves.   How fond she is of finding morals in things Alice thought to herself.  I dare say you re wondering why I don t put my arm round your waist, the Duchess said after a pause the reason is, that I m doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment  He might bite, Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried.  Very true, said the Duchess flamingoes and mustard both bite. And the moral of that is—‘Birds of a feather flock together.   Only mustard isn t a bird, Alice remarked.  Right, as usual, said the Duchess what a clear way you have of putting things  It s a mineral, I think, said Alice.  Of course it is, said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to everything that Alice said there s a large mustard-mine near here. And the moral of that is—‘The more there is of mine, the less there is of yours.   Oh, I know exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark, it s a vegetable. It doesn t look like one, but it is.  I quite agree with you, said the Duchess and the moral of that is—‘Be what you would seem to be —or if you d like it put more simply—‘Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.   I think I should understand that better, Alice said very politely, if I had it written down but I can t quite follow it as you say it.  That s nothing to what I could say if I chose, the Duchess replied, in a pleased tone.  Pray don t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that, said Alice.  Oh, don t talk about trouble said the Duchess. I make you a present of everything I ve said as yet.  A cheap sort of present thought Alice. I m glad they don t give birthday presents like that But she did not venture to say it out loud.  Thinking again the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp little chin.  I ve a right to think, said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to feel a little worried.  Just about as much right, said the Duchess, as pigs have to fly and the m—  But here, to Alice s great surprise, the Duchess s voice died away, even in the middle of her favourite word ‘moral,  and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.  A fine day, your Majesty the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.  Now, I give you fair warning, shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as she spoke either you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time Take your choice  The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.  Let s go on with the game, the Queen said to Alice and Alice was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground.  The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen s absence, and were resting in the shade however, the moment they saw her, they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment s delay would cost them their lives.  All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with the other players, and shouting Off with his head or Off with her head Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of execution.  Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet  No, said Alice. I don t even know what a Mock Turtle is.  It s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from, said the Queen.  I never saw one, or heard of one, said Alice.  Come on, then, said the Queen, and he shall tell you his history,  As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to the company generally, You are all pardoned. Come, that s a good thing she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.  They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. If you don t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture. Up, lazy thing said the Queen, and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen so she waited.  The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes then it watched the Queen till she was out of sight then it chuckled. What fun said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.  What is the fun said Alice.  Why, she, said the Gryphon. It s all her fancy, that they never executes nobody, you know. Come on  Everybody says ‘come on  here, thought Alice, as she went slowly after it I never was so ordered about in all my life, never  They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She pitied him deeply. What is his sorrow she asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, It s all his fancy, that he hasn t got no sorrow, you know. Come on  So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.  This here young lady, said the Gryphon, she wants for to know your history, she do.  I ll tell it her, said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone sit down, both of you, and don t speak a word till I ve finished.  So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to herself, I don t see how he can ever finish, if he doesn t begin. But she waited patiently.  Once, said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, I was a real Turtle.  These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation of Hjckrrh from the Gryphon, and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and saying, Thank you, sir, for your interesting story, but she could not help thinking there must be more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.  When we were little, the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, we went to school in the sea. The master was an old Turtle—we used to call him Tortoise—  Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn t one Alice asked.  We called him Tortoise because he taught us, said the Mock Turtle angrily really you are very dull  You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question, added the Gryphon and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, Drive on, old fellow Don t be all day about it and he went on in these words  Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn t believe it—  I never said I didn t interrupted Alice.  You did, said the Mock Turtle.  Hold your tongue added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again. The Mock Turtle went on.  We had the best of educations—in fact, we went to school every day—  I ve been to a day-school, too, said Alice you needn t be so proud as all that.  With extras asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.  Yes, said Alice, we learned French and music.  And washing said the Mock Turtle.  Certainly not said Alice indignantly.  Ah then yours wasn t a really good school, said the Mock Turtle in a tone of great relief. Now at ours they had at the end of the bill, ‘French, music, and washing—extra.   You couldn t have wanted it much, said Alice living at the bottom of the sea.  I couldn t afford to learn it. said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. I only took the regular course.  What was that inquired Alice.  Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with, the Mock Turtle replied and then the different branches of Arithmetic—Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.  I never heard of ‘Uglification,  Alice ventured to say. What is it  The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. What Never heard of uglifying it exclaimed. You know what to beautify is, I suppose  Yes, said Alice doubtfully it means—to—make—anything—prettier.  Well, then, the Gryphon went on, if you don t know what to uglify is, you are a simpleton.  Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said What else had you to learn  Well, there was Mystery, the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the subjects on his flappers, —Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography then Drawling—the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel, that used to come once a week he taught us Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.  What was that like said Alice.  Well, I can t show it you myself, the Mock Turtle said I m too stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.  Hadn t time, said the Gryphon I went to the Classics master, though. He was an old crab, he was.  I never went to him, the Mock Turtle said with a sigh he taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.  So he did, so he did, said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.  And how many hours a day did you do lessons said Alice, in a hurry to change the subject.  Ten hours the first day, said the Mock Turtle nine the next, and so on.  What a curious plan exclaimed Alice.  That s the reason they re called lessons, the Gryphon remarked because they lessen from day to day.  This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark. Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday  Of course it was, said the Mock Turtle.  And how did you manage on the twelfth Alice went on eagerly.  That s enough about lessons, the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone tell her something about the games now.     CHAPTER X. The Lobster Quadrille   The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice. Same as if he had a bone in his throat, said the Gryphon and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on again—  You may not have lived much under the sea— I haven t, said Alice—and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster— Alice began to say I once tasted— but checked herself hastily, and said No, never —so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is  No, indeed, said Alice. What sort of a dance is it  Why, said the Gryphon, you first form into a line along the sea-shore—  Two lines cried the Mock Turtle. Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on then, when you ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way—  That generally takes some time, interrupted the Gryphon.  —you advance twice—  Each with a lobster as a partner cried the Gryphon.  Of course, the Mock Turtle said advance twice, set to partners—  —change lobsters, and retire in same order, continued the Gryphon.  Then, you know, the Mock Turtle went on, you throw the—  The lobsters shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.  —as far out to sea as you can—  Swim after them screamed the Gryphon.  Turn a somersault in the sea cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly about.  Change lobsters again yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.  Back to land again, and that s all the first figure, said the Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice and the two creatures, who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.  It must be a very pretty dance, said Alice timidly.  Would you like to see a little of it said the Mock Turtle.  Very much indeed, said Alice.  Come, let s try the first figure said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon. We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing  Oh, you sing, said the Gryphon. I ve forgotten the words.  So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly and sadly—  Will you walk a little faster said a whiting to a snail. There s a porpoise close behind us, and he s treading on my tail. See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance They are waiting on the shingle—will you come and join the dance Will you, won t you, will you, won t you, will you join the dance Will you, won t you, will you, won t you, won t you join the dance  You can really have no notion how delightful it will be When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea But the snail replied Too far, too far and gave a look askance— Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance. Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance. Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.  What matters it how far we go his scaly friend replied. There is another shore, you know, upon the other side. The further off from England the nearer is to France— Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance. Will you, won t you, will you, won t you, will you join the dance Will you, won t you, will you, won t you, won t you join the dance   Thank you, it s a very interesting dance to watch, said Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last and I do so like that curious song about the whiting  Oh, as to the whiting, said the Mock Turtle, they—you ve seen them, of course  Yes, said Alice, I ve often seen them at dinn— she checked herself hastily.  I don t know where Dinn may be, said the Mock Turtle, but if you ve seen them so often, of course you know what they re like.  I believe so, Alice replied thoughtfully. They have their tails in their mouths—and they re all over crumbs.  You re wrong about the crumbs, said the Mock Turtle crumbs would all wash off in the sea. But they have their tails in their mouths and the reason is— here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.—Tell her about the reason and all that, he said to the Gryphon.  The reason is, said the Gryphon, that they would go with the lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn t get them out again. That s all.  Thank you, said Alice, it s very interesting. I never knew so much about a whiting before.  I can tell you more than that, if you like, said the Gryphon. Do you know why it s called a whiting  I never thought about it, said Alice. Why  It does the boots and shoes, the Gryphon replied very solemnly.  Alice was thoroughly puzzled. Does the boots and shoes she repeated in a wondering tone.  Why, what are your shoes done with said the Gryphon. I mean, what makes them so shiny  Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her answer. They re done with blacking, I believe.  Boots and shoes under the sea, the Gryphon went on in a deep voice, are done with a whiting. Now you know.  And what are they made of Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.  Soles and eels, of course, the Gryphon replied rather impatiently any shrimp could have told you that.  If I d been the whiting, said Alice, whose thoughts were still running on the song, I d have said to the porpoise, ‘Keep back, please we don t want you with us   They were obliged to have him with them, the Mock Turtle said no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.  Wouldn t it really said Alice in a tone of great surprise.  Of course not, said the Mock Turtle why, if a fish came to me, and told me he was going a journey, I should say ‘With what porpoise   Don t you mean ‘purpose  said Alice.  I mean what I say, the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And the Gryphon added Come, let s hear some of your adventures.  I could tell you my adventures—beginning from this morning, said Alice a little timidly but it s no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.  Explain all that, said the Mock Turtle.  No, no The adventures first, said the Gryphon in an impatient tone explanations take such a dreadful time.  So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide, but she gained courage as she went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating You are old, Father William, to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said That s very curious.  It s all about as curious as it can be, said the Gryphon.  It all came different the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. I should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to begin. He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.  Stand up and repeat ‘ Tis the voice of the sluggard,  said the Gryphon.  How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons thought Alice I might as well be at school at once. However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came very queer indeed—   Tis the voice of the Lobster I heard him declare, You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair. As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.  [later editions continued as follows When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark, And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark, But, when the tide rises and sharks are around, His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]   That s different from what I used to say when I was a child, said the Gryphon.  Well, I never heard it before, said the Mock Turtle but it sounds uncommon nonsense.  Alice said nothing she had sat down with her face in her hands, wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way again.  I should like to have it explained, said the Mock Turtle.  She can t explain it, said the Gryphon hastily. Go on with the next verse.  But about his toes the Mock Turtle persisted. How could he turn them out with his nose, you know  It s the first position in dancing. Alice said but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.  Go on with the next verse, the Gryphon repeated impatiently it begins ‘I passed by his garden.   Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice—  I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye, How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie—  [later editions continued as follows The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat, While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat. When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon, Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl, And concluded the banquet—]   What is the use of repeating all that stuff, the Mock Turtle interrupted, if you don t explain it as you go on It s by far the most confusing thing I ever heard  Yes, I think you d better leave off, said the Gryphon and Alice was only too glad to do so.  Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille the Gryphon went on. Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song  Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind, Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone, Hm No accounting for tastes Sing her ‘Turtle Soup,  will you, old fellow  The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked with sobs, to sing this—  Beautiful Soup, so rich and green, Waiting in a hot tureen Who for such dainties would not stoop Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup     Beau—ootiful Soo—oop     Beau—ootiful Soo—oop Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,     Beautiful, beautiful Soup  Beautiful Soup Who cares for fish, Game, or any other dish Who would not give all else for two p ennyworth only of beautiful Soup Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup     Beau—ootiful Soo—oop     Beau—ootiful Soo—oop Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,     Beautiful, beauti—FUL SOUP   Chorus again cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun to repeat it, when a cry of The trial s beginning was heard in the distance.  Come on cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song.  What trial is it Alice panted as she ran but the Gryphon only answered Come on and ran the faster, while more and more faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words—  Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,     Beautiful, beautiful Soup     CHAPTER XI. Who Stole the Tarts   The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them—all sorts of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it they looked so good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them—I wish they d get the trial done, she thought, and hand round the refreshments But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about her, to pass away the time.  Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there. That s the judge, she said to herself, because of his great wig.  The judge, by the way, was the King and as he wore his crown over the wig, look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it, he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.  And that s the jury-box, thought Alice, and those twelve creatures, she was obliged to say creatures, you see, because some of them were animals, and some were birds, I suppose they are the jurors. She said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of it for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, jury-men would have done just as well.  The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. What are they doing Alice whispered to the Gryphon. They can t have anything to put down yet, before the trial s begun.  They re putting down their names, the Gryphon whispered in reply, for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.  Stupid things Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, Silence in the court and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who was talking.  Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down stupid things on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them didn t know how to spell stupid, and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. A nice muddle their slates ll be in before the trial s over thought Alice.  One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly that the poor little juror it was Bill, the Lizard could not make out at all what had become of it so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day and this was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.  Herald, read the accusation said the King.  On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows—  The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,     All on a summer day The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,     And took them quite away   Consider your verdict, the King said to the jury.  Not yet, not yet the Rabbit hastily interrupted. There s a great deal to come before that  Call the first witness, said the King and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, First witness  The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. I beg pardon, your Majesty, he began, for bringing these in but I hadn t quite finished my tea when I was sent for.  You ought to have finished, said the King. When did you begin  The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. Fourteenth of March, I think it was, he said.  Fifteenth, said the March Hare.  Sixteenth, added the Dormouse.  Write that down, the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.  Take off your hat, the King said to the Hatter.  It isn t mine, said the Hatter.  Stolen the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a memorandum of the fact.  I keep them to sell, the Hatter added as an explanation I ve none of my own. I m a hatter.  Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.  Give your evidence, said the King and don t be nervous, or I ll have you executed on the spot.  This did not seem to encourage the witness at all he kept shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.  Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was she was beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her.  I wish you wouldn t squeeze so. said the Dormouse, who was sitting next to her. I can hardly breathe.  I can t help it, said Alice very meekly I m growing.  You ve no right to grow here, said the Dormouse.  Don t talk nonsense, said Alice more boldly you know you re growing too.  Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace, said the Dormouse not in that ridiculous fashion. And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court.  All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers of the court, Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.  Give your evidence, the King repeated angrily, or I ll have you executed, whether you re nervous or not.  I m a poor man, your Majesty, the Hatter began, in a trembling voice, —and I hadn t begun my tea—not above a week or so—and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin—and the twinkling of the tea—  The twinkling of the what said the King.  It began with the tea, the Hatter replied.  Of course twinkling begins with a T said the King sharply. Do you take me for a dunce Go on  I m a poor man, the Hatter went on, and most things twinkled after that—only the March Hare said—  I didn t the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.  You did said the Hatter.  I deny it said the March Hare.  He denies it, said the King leave out that part.  Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said— the Hatter went on, looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too but the Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.  After that, continued the Hatter, I cut some more bread-and-butter—  But what did the Dormouse say one of the jury asked.  That I can t remember, said the Hatter.  You must remember, remarked the King, or I ll have you executed.  The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went down on one knee. I m a poor man, your Majesty, he began.  You re a very poor speaker, said the King.  Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court. As that is rather a hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat upon it.  I m glad I ve seen that done, thought Alice. I ve so often read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, There was some attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court, and I never understood what it meant till now.  If that s all you know about it, you may stand down, continued the King.  I can t go no lower, said the Hatter I m on the floor, as it is.  Then you may sit down, the King replied.  Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.  Come, that finished the guinea-pigs thought Alice. Now we shall get on better.  I d rather finish my tea, said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.  You may go, said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court, without even waiting to put his shoes on.  —and just take his head off outside, the Queen added to one of the officers but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door.  Call the next witness said the King.  The next witness was the Duchess s cook. She carried the pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.  Give your evidence, said the King.  Shan t, said the cook.  The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice, Your Majesty must cross-examine this witness.  Well, if I must, I must, the King said, with a melancholy air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, What are tarts made of  Pepper, mostly, said the cook.  Treacle, said a sleepy voice behind her.  Collar that Dormouse, the Queen shrieked out. Behead that Dormouse Turn that Dormouse out of court Suppress him Pinch him Off with his whiskers  For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared.  Never mind said the King, with an air of great relief. Call the next witness. And he added in an undertone to the Queen, Really, my dear, you must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead ache  Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like, —for they haven t got much evidence yet, she said to herself. Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the name Alice     CHAPTER XII. Alice s Evidence   Here cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.  Oh, I beg your pardon she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.  The trial cannot proceed, said the King in a very grave voice, until all the jurymen are back in their proper places—all, he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.  Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got it out again, and put it right not that it signifies much, she said to herself I should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other.  As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the court.  What do you know about this business the King said to Alice.  Nothing, said Alice.  Nothing whatever persisted the King.  Nothing whatever, said Alice.  That s very important, the King said, turning to the jury. They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit interrupted Unimportant, your Majesty means, of course, he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.  Unimportant, of course, I meant, the King hastily said, and went on to himself in an undertone,  important—unimportant—unimportant—important— as if he were trying which word sounded best.  Some of the jury wrote it down important, and some unimportant. Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates but it doesn t matter a bit, she thought to herself.  At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in his note-book, cackled out Silence and read out from his book, Rule Forty-two. All persons more than a mile high to leave the court.  Everybody looked at Alice.  I m not a mile high, said Alice.  You are, said the King.  Nearly two miles high, added the Queen.  Well, I shan t go, at any rate, said Alice besides, that s not a regular rule you invented it just now.  It s the oldest rule in the book, said the King.  Then it ought to be Number One, said Alice.  The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. Consider your verdict, he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.  There s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty, said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry this paper has just been picked up.  What s in it said the Queen.  I haven t opened it yet, said the White Rabbit, but it seems to be a letter, written by the prisoner to—to somebody.  It must have been that, said the King, unless it was written to nobody, which isn t usual, you know.  Who is it directed to said one of the jurymen.  It isn t directed at all, said the White Rabbit in fact, there s nothing written on the outside. He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and added It isn t a letter, after all it s a set of verses.  Are they in the prisoner s handwriting asked another of the jurymen.  No, they re not, said the White Rabbit, and that s the queerest thing about it. The jury all looked puzzled.  He must have imitated somebody else s hand, said the King. The jury all brightened up again.  Please your Majesty, said the Knave, I didn t write it, and they can t prove I did there s no name signed at the end.  If you didn t sign it, said the King, that only makes the matter worse. You must have meant some mischief, or else you d have signed your name like an honest man.  There was a general clapping of hands at this it was the first really clever thing the King had said that day.  That proves his guilt, said the Queen.  It proves nothing of the sort said Alice. Why, you don t even know what they re about  Read them, said the King.  The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. Where shall I begin, please your Majesty he asked.  Begin at the beginning, the King said gravely, and go on till you come to the end then stop.  These were the verses the White Rabbit read—  They told me you had been to her,     And mentioned me to him She gave me a good character,     But said I could not swim.  He sent them word I had not gone     We know it to be true If she should push the matter on,     What would become of you  I gave her one, they gave him two,     You gave us three or more They all returned from him to you,     Though they were mine before.  If I or she should chance to be     Involved in this affair, He trusts to you to set them free,     Exactly as we were.  My notion was that you had been     Before she had this fit An obstacle that came between     Him, and ourselves, and it.  Don t let him know she liked them best,     For this must ever be A secret, kept from all the rest,     Between yourself and me.   That s the most important piece of evidence we ve heard yet, said the King, rubbing his hands so now let the jury—  If any one of them can explain it, said Alice, she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn t a bit afraid of interrupting him, I ll give him sixpence. I don t believe there s an atom of meaning in it.  The jury all wrote down on their slates, She doesn t believe there s an atom of meaning in it, but none of them attempted to explain the paper.  If there s no meaning in it, said the King, that saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn t try to find any. And yet I don t know, he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them with one eye I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. —said I could not swim— you can t swim, can you he added, turning to the Knave.  The Knave shook his head sadly. Do I look like it he said. Which he certainly did not, being made entirely of cardboard.  All right, so far, said the King, and he went on muttering over the verses to himself ‘We know it to be true—  that s the jury, of course—‘I gave her one, they gave him two—  why, that must be what he did with the tarts, you know—  But, it goes on ‘they all returned from him to you,  said Alice.  Why, there they are said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts on the table. Nothing can be clearer than that. Then again—‘before she had this fit—  you never had fits, my dear, I think he said to the Queen.  Never said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke. The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.  Then the words don t fit you, said the King, looking round the court with a smile. There was a dead silence.  It s a pun the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed, Let the jury consider their verdict, the King said, for about the twentieth time that day.  No, no said the Queen. Sentence first—verdict afterwards.  Stuff and nonsense said Alice loudly. The idea of having the sentence first  Hold your tongue said the Queen, turning purple.  I won t said Alice.  Off with her head the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved.  Who cares for you said Alice, she had grown to her full size by this time. You re nothing but a pack of cards  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.  Wake up, Alice dear said her sister Why, what a long sleep you ve had  Oh, I ve had such a curious dream said Alice, and she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about and when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, It was a curious dream, dear, certainly but now run in to your tea it s getting late. So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.   But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream—  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers—she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister s dream.  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool—she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the Duchess s knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it—once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle.  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality—the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds—the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen s shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy—and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change she knew to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard—while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle s heavy sobs.  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood and how she would gather about her other little children, and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.

no pictur or convers in it , and what is the use of a book , thought alic without pictur or convers so she wa consid in her own mind as well as she could , for the hot day made her feel veri sleepi and stupid , whether the pleasur of make a daisy-chain would be worth the troubl of get up and pick the daisi , when suddenli a white rabbit with pink eye ran close by her . there wa noth so veri remark in that nor did alic think it so veri much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself , oh dear oh dear i shall be late when she thought it over afterward , it occur to her that she ought to have wonder at thi , but at the time it all seem quit natur but when the rabbit actual took a watch out of it waistcoat-pocket , and look at it , and then hurri on , alic start to her feet , for it flash across her mind that she had never befor seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket , or a watch to take out of it , and burn with curios , she ran across the field after it , and fortun wa just in time to see it pop down a larg rabbit-hol under the hedg . in anoth moment down went alic after it , never onc consid how in the world she wa to get out again . the rabbit-hol went straight on like a tunnel for some way , and then dip suddenli down , so suddenli that alic had not a moment to think about stop herself befor she found herself fall down a veri deep well . either the well wa veri deep , or she fell veri slowli , for she had plenti of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what wa go to happen next . first , she tri to look down and make out what she wa come to , but it wa too dark to see anyth then she look at the side of the well , and notic that they were fill with cupboard and book-shelv here and there she saw map and pictur hung upon peg . she took down a jar from one of the shelv as she pass it wa label orang marmalad , but to her great disappoint it wa empti she did not like to drop the jar for fear of kill somebodi underneath , so manag to put it into one of the cupboard as she fell past it . well thought alic to herself , after such a fall as thi , i shall think noth of tumbl down stair how brave they ll all think me at home whi , i wouldn t say anyth about it , even if i fell off the top of the hous which wa veri like true . down , down , down . would the fall never come to an end i wonder how mani mile i ve fallen by thi time she said aloud . i must be get somewher near the centr of the earth . let me see that would be four thousand mile down , i think— for , you see , alic had learnt sever thing of thi sort in her lesson in the schoolroom , and though thi wa not a veri good opportun for show off her knowledg , as there wa no one to listen to her , still it wa good practic to say it over —ye , that s about the right distance—but then i wonder what latitud or longitud i ve got to alic had no idea what latitud wa , or longitud either , but thought they were nice grand word to say . present she began again . i wonder if i shall fall right through the earth how funni it ll seem to come out among the peopl that walk with their head downward the antipathi , i think— she wa rather glad there wa no one listen , thi time , as it didn t sound at all the right word —but i shall have to ask them what the name of the countri is , you know . pleas , ma am , is thi new zealand or australia and she tri to curtsey as she spoke—f curtsey as you re fall through the air do you think you could manag it and what an ignor littl girl she ll think me for ask no , it ll never do to ask perhap i shall see it written up somewher . down , down , down . there wa noth els to do , so alic soon began talk again . dinah ll miss me veri much to-night , i should think dinah wa the cat . i hope they ll rememb her saucer of milk at tea-tim . dinah my dear i wish you were down here with me there are no mice in the air , i m afraid , but you might catch a bat , and that s veri like a mous , you know . but do cat eat bat , i wonder and here alic began to get rather sleepi , and went on say to herself , in a dreami sort of way , do cat eat bat do cat eat bat and sometim , do bat eat cat for , you see , as she couldn t answer either question , it didn t much matter which way she put it . she felt that she wa doze off , and had just begun to dream that she wa walk hand in hand with dinah , and say to her veri earnestli , now , dinah , tell me the truth did you ever eat a bat when suddenli , thump thump down she came upon a heap of stick and dri leav , and the fall wa over . alic wa not a bit hurt , and she jump up on to her feet in a moment she look up , but it wa all dark overhead befor her wa anoth long passag , and the white rabbit wa still in sight , hurri down it . there wa not a moment to be lost away went alic like the wind , and wa just in time to hear it say , as it turn a corner , oh my ear and whisker , how late it s get she wa close behind it when she turn the corner , but the rabbit wa no longer to be seen she found herself in a long , low hall , which wa lit up by a row of lamp hang from the roof . there were door all round the hall , but they were all lock and when alic had been all the way down one side and up the other , tri everi door , she walk sadli down the middl , wonder how she wa ever to get out again . suddenli she came upon a littl three-leg tabl , all made of solid glass there wa noth on it except a tini golden key , and alic s first thought wa that it might belong to one of the door of the hall but , ala either the lock were too larg , or the key wa too small , but at ani rate it would not open ani of them . howev , on the second time round , she came upon a low curtain she had not notic befor , and behind it wa a littl door about fifteen inch high she tri the littl golden key in the lock , and to her great delight it fit alic open the door and found that it led into a small passag , not much larger than a rat-hol she knelt down and look along the passag into the loveliest garden you ever saw . how she long to get out of that dark hall , and wander about among those bed of bright flower and those cool fountain , but she could not even get her head through the doorway and even if my head would go through , thought poor alic , it would be of veri littl use without my shoulder . oh , how i wish i could shut up like a telescop i think i could , if i onli knew how to begin . for , you see , so mani out-of-the-way thing had happen late , that alic had begun to think that veri few thing inde were realli imposs . there seem to be no use in wait by the littl door , so she went back to the tabl , half hope she might find anoth key on it , or at ani rate a book of rule for shut peopl up like telescop thi time she found a littl bottl on it , which certainli wa not here befor , said alic , and round the neck of the bottl wa a paper label , with the word drink me , beauti print on it in larg letter . it wa all veri well to say drink me , but the wise littl alic wa not go to do that in a hurri . no , i ll look first , she said , and see whether it s mark ‘ poison or not for she had read sever nice littl histori about children who had got burnt , and eaten up by wild beast and other unpleas thing , all becaus they would not rememb the simpl rule their friend had taught them such as , that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long and that if you cut your finger veri deepli with a knife , it usual bleed and she had never forgotten that , if you drink much from a bottl mark poison , it is almost certain to disagre with you , sooner or later . howev , thi bottl wa not mark poison , so alic ventur to tast it , and find it veri nice , it had , in fact , a sort of mix flavour of cherry-tart , custard , pine-appl , roast turkey , toffe , and hot butter toast , she veri soon finish it off . what a curiou feel said alic i must be shut up like a telescop . and so it wa inde she wa now onli ten inch high , and her face brighten up at the thought that she wa now the right size for go through the littl door into that love garden . first , howev , she wait for a few minut to see if she wa go to shrink ani further she felt a littl nervou about thi for it might end , you know , said alic to herself , in my go out altogeth , like a candl . i wonder what i should be like then and she tri to fanci what the flame of a candl is like after the candl is blown out , for she could not rememb ever have seen such a thing . after a while , find that noth more happen , she decid on go into the garden at onc but , ala for poor alic when she got to the door , she found she had forgotten the littl golden key , and when she went back to the tabl for it , she found she could not possibl reach it she could see it quit plainli through the glass , and she tri her best to climb up one of the leg of the tabl , but it wa too slipperi and when she had tire herself out with tri , the poor littl thing sat down and cri . come , there s no use in cri like that said alic to herself , rather sharpli i advis you to leav off thi minut she gener gave herself veri good advic , though she veri seldom follow it , and sometim she scold herself so sever as to bring tear into her eye and onc she rememb tri to box her own ear for have cheat herself in a game of croquet she wa play against herself , for thi curiou child wa veri fond of pretend to be two peopl . but it s no use now , thought poor alic , to pretend to be two peopl whi , there s hardli enough of me left to make one respect person soon her eye fell on a littl glass box that wa lie under the tabl she open it , and found in it a veri small cake , on which the word eat me were beauti mark in currant . well , i ll eat it , said alic , and if it make me grow larger , i can reach the key and if it make me grow smaller , i can creep under the door so either way i ll get into the garden , and i don t care which happen she ate a littl bit , and said anxious to herself , which way which way , hold her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it wa grow , and she wa quit surpris to find that she remain the same size to be sure , thi gener happen when one eat cake , but alic had got so much into the way of expect noth but out-of-the-way thing to happen , that it seem quit dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way . so she set to work , and veri soon finish off the cake . chapter ii . the pool of tear curious and curious cri alic she wa so much surpris , that for the moment she quit forgot how to speak good english now i m open out like the largest telescop that ever wa good-by , feet for when she look down at her feet , they seem to be almost out of sight , they were get so far off . oh , my poor littl feet , i wonder who will put on your shoe and stock for you now , dear i m sure i shan t be abl i shall be a great deal too far off to troubl myself about you you must manag the best way you can—but i must be kind to them , thought alic , or perhap they won t walk the way i want to go let me see i ll give them a new pair of boot everi christma . and she went on plan to herself how she would manag it . they must go by the carrier , she thought and how funni it ll seem , send present to one s own feet and how odd the direct will look alic s right foot , esq. , hearthrug , near the fender , with alic s love . oh dear , what nonsens i m talk just then her head struck against the roof of the hall in fact she wa now more than nine feet high , and she at onc took up the littl golden key and hurri off to the garden door . poor alic it wa as much as she could do , lie down on one side , to look through into the garden with one eye but to get through wa more hopeless than ever she sat down and began to cri again . you ought to be asham of yourself , said alic , a great girl like you , she might well say thi , to go on cri in thi way stop thi moment , i tell you but she went on all the same , shed gallon of tear , until there wa a larg pool all round her , about four inch deep and reach half down the hall . after a time she heard a littl patter of feet in the distanc , and she hastili dri her eye to see what wa come . it wa the white rabbit return , splendidli dress , with a pair of white kid glove in one hand and a larg fan in the other he came trot along in a great hurri , mutter to himself as he came , oh the duchess , the duchess oh won t she be savag if i ve kept her wait alic felt so desper that she wa readi to ask help of ani one so , when the rabbit came near her , she began , in a low , timid voic , if you pleas , sir— the rabbit start violent , drop the white kid glove and the fan , and skurri away into the dark as hard as he could go . alic took up the fan and glove , and , as the hall wa veri hot , she kept fan herself all the time she went on talk dear , dear how queer everyth is to-day and yesterday thing went on just as usual . i wonder if i ve been chang in the night let me think wa i the same when i got up thi morn i almost think i can rememb feel a littl differ . but if i m not the same , the next question is , who in the world am i ah , that s the great puzzl and she began think over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself , to see if she could have been chang for ani of them . i m sure i m not ada , she said , for her hair goe in such long ringlet , and mine doesn t go in ringlet at all and i m sure i can t be mabel , for i know all sort of thing , and she , oh she know such a veri littl besid , she s she , and i m i , and—oh dear , how puzzl it all is i ll tri if i know all the thing i use to know . let me see four time five is twelv , and four time six is thirteen , and four time seven is—oh dear i shall never get to twenti at that rate howev , the multipl tabl doesn t signifi let s tri geographi . london is the capit of pari , and pari is the capit of rome , and rome—no , that s all wrong , i m certain i must have been chang for mabel i ll tri and say ‘ how doth the little— and she cross her hand on her lap as if she were say lesson , and began to repeat it , but her voic sound hoars and strang , and the word did not come the same as they use to do— how doth the littl crocodil improv hi shine tail , and pour the water of the nile on everi golden scale how cheer he seem to grin , how neatli spread hi claw , and welcom littl fish in with gentli smile jaw i m sure those are not the right word , said poor alic , and her eye fill with tear again as she went on , i must be mabel after all , and i shall have to go and live in that poki littl hous , and have next to no toy to play with , and oh ever so mani lesson to learn no , i ve made up my mind about it if i m mabel , i ll stay down here it ll be no use their put their head down and say ‘ come up again , dear i shall onli look up and say ‘ who am i then tell me that first , and then , if i like be that person , i ll come up if not , i ll stay down here till i m somebodi els —but , oh dear cri alic , with a sudden burst of tear , i do wish they would put their head down i am so veri tire of be all alon here as she said thi she look down at her hand , and wa surpris to see that she had put on one of the rabbit s littl white kid glove while she wa talk . how can i have done that she thought . i must be grow small again . she got up and went to the tabl to measur herself by it , and found that , as nearli as she could guess , she wa now about two feet high , and wa go on shrink rapidli she soon found out that the caus of thi wa the fan she wa hold , and she drop it hastili , just in time to avoid shrink away altogeth . that wa a narrow escap said alic , a good deal frighten at the sudden chang , but veri glad to find herself still in exist and now for the garden and she ran with all speed back to the littl door but , ala the littl door wa shut again , and the littl golden key wa lie on the glass tabl as befor , and thing are wors than ever , thought the poor child , for i never wa so small as thi befor , never and i declar it s too bad , that it is as she said these word her foot slip , and in anoth moment , splash she wa up to her chin in salt water . her first idea wa that she had somehow fallen into the sea , and in that case i can go back by railway , she said to herself . alic had been to the seasid onc in her life , and had come to the gener conclus , that wherev you go to on the english coast you find a number of bath machin in the sea , some children dig in the sand with wooden spade , then a row of lodg hous , and behind them a railway station . howev , she soon made out that she wa in the pool of tear which she had wept when she wa nine feet high . i wish i hadn t cri so much said alic , as she swam about , tri to find her way out . i shall be punish for it now , i suppos , by be drown in my own tear that will be a queer thing , to be sure howev , everyth is queer to-day . just then she heard someth splash about in the pool a littl way off , and she swam nearer to make out what it wa at first she thought it must be a walru or hippopotamu , but then she rememb how small she wa now , and she soon made out that it wa onli a mous that had slip in like herself . would it be of ani use , now , thought alic , to speak to thi mous everyth is so out-of-the-way down here , that i should think veri like it can talk at ani rate , there s no harm in tri . so she began o mous , do you know the way out of thi pool i am veri tire of swim about here , o mous alic thought thi must be the right way of speak to a mous she had never done such a thing befor , but she rememb have seen in her brother s latin grammar , a mouse—of a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—o mous the mous look at her rather inquisit , and seem to her to wink with one of it littl eye , but it said noth . perhap it doesn t understand english , thought alic i daresay it s a french mous , come over with william the conqueror . for , with all her knowledg of histori , alic had no veri clear notion how long ago anyth had happen . so she began again où est ma chatt which wa the first sentenc in her french lesson-book . the mous gave a sudden leap out of the water , and seem to quiver all over with fright . oh , i beg your pardon cri alic hastili , afraid that she had hurt the poor anim s feel . i quit forgot you didn t like cat . not like cat cri the mous , in a shrill , passion voic . would you like cat if you were me well , perhap not , said alic in a sooth tone don t be angri about it . and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah i think you d take a fanci to cat if you could onli see her . she is such a dear quiet thing , alic went on , half to herself , as she swam lazili about in the pool , and she sit pur so nice by the fire , lick her paw and wash her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse—and she s such a capit one for catch mice—oh , i beg your pardon cri alic again , for thi time the mous wa bristl all over , and she felt certain it must be realli offend . we won t talk about her ani more if you d rather not . we inde cri the mous , who wa trembl down to the end of hi tail . as if i would talk on such a subject our famili alway hate cat nasti , low , vulgar thing don t let me hear the name again i won t inde said alic , in a great hurri to chang the subject of convers . are you—ar you fond—of—of dog the mous did not answer , so alic went on eagerli there is such a nice littl dog near our hous i should like to show you a littl bright-ey terrier , you know , with oh , such long curli brown hair and it ll fetch thing when you throw them , and it ll sit up and beg for it dinner , and all sort of things—i can t rememb half of them—and it belong to a farmer , you know , and he say it s so use , it s worth a hundr pound he say it kill all the rat and—oh dear cri alic in a sorrow tone , i m afraid i ve offend it again for the mous wa swim away from her as hard as it could go , and make quit a commot in the pool as it went . so she call softli after it , mous dear do come back again , and we won t talk about cat or dog either , if you don t like them when the mous heard thi , it turn round and swam slowli back to her it face wa quit pale with passion , alic thought , and it said in a low trembl voic , let us get to the shore , and then i ll tell you my histori , and you ll understand whi it is i hate cat and dog . it wa high time to go , for the pool wa get quit crowd with the bird and anim that had fallen into it there were a duck and a dodo , a lori and an eaglet , and sever other curiou creatur . alic led the way , and the whole parti swam to the shore . chapter iii . a caucus-rac and a long tale they were inde a queer-look parti that assembl on the bank—th bird with draggl feather , the anim with their fur cling close to them , and all drip wet , cross , and uncomfort . the first question of cours wa , how to get dri again they had a consult about thi , and after a few minut it seem quit natur to alic to find herself talk familiarli with them , as if she had known them all her life . inde , she had quit a long argument with the lori , who at last turn sulki , and would onli say , i am older than you , and must know better and thi alic would not allow without know how old it wa , and , as the lori posit refus to tell it age , there wa no more to be said . at last the mous , who seem to be a person of author among them , call out , sit down , all of you , and listen to me i ll soon make you dri enough they all sat down at onc , in a larg ring , with the mous in the middl . alic kept her eye anxious fix on it , for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dri veri soon . ahem said the mous with an import air , are you all readi thi is the driest thing i know . silenc all round , if you pleas ‘ william the conqueror , whose caus wa favour by the pope , wa soon submit to by the english , who want leader , and had been of late much accustom to usurp and conquest . edwin and morcar , the earl of mercia and northumbria— ugh said the lori , with a shiver . i beg your pardon said the mous , frown , but veri polit did you speak not i said the lori hastili . i thought you did , said the mous . —i proceed . ‘ edwin and morcar , the earl of mercia and northumbria , declar for him and even stigand , the patriot archbishop of canterburi , found it advisable— found what said the duck . found it , the mous repli rather crossli of cours you know what ‘ it mean . i know what ‘ it mean well enough , when i find a thing , said the duck it s gener a frog or a worm . the question is , what did the archbishop find the mous did not notic thi question , but hurriedli went on , ‘ —found it advis to go with edgar athel to meet william and offer him the crown . william s conduct at first wa moder . but the insol of hi normans— how are you get on now , my dear it continu , turn to alic as it spoke . as wet as ever , said alic in a melancholi tone it doesn t seem to dri me at all . in that case , said the dodo solemnli , rise to it feet , i move that the meet adjourn , for the immedi adopt of more energet remedies— speak english said the eaglet . i don t know the mean of half those long word , and , what s more , i don t believ you do either and the eaglet bent down it head to hide a smile some of the other bird titter audibl . what i wa go to say , said the dodo in an offend tone , wa , that the best thing to get us dri would be a caucus-rac . what is a caucus-rac said alic not that she want much to know , but the dodo had paus as if it thought that somebodi ought to speak , and no one els seem inclin to say anyth . whi , said the dodo , the best way to explain it is to do it . and , as you might like to tri the thing yourself , some winter day , i will tell you how the dodo manag it . first it mark out a race-cours , in a sort of circl , the exact shape doesn t matter , it said , and then all the parti were place along the cours , here and there . there wa no one , two , three , and away , but they began run when they like , and left off when they like , so that it wa not easi to know when the race wa over . howev , when they had been run half an hour or so , and were quit dri again , the dodo suddenli call out the race is over and they all crowd round it , pant , and ask , but who ha won thi question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought , and it sat for a long time with one finger press upon it forehead the posit in which you usual see shakespear , in the pictur of him , while the rest wait in silenc . at last the dodo said , everybodi ha won , and all must have prize . but who is to give the prize quit a choru of voic ask . whi , she , of cours , said the dodo , point to alic with one finger and the whole parti at onc crowd round her , call out in a confus way , prize prize alic had no idea what to do , and in despair she put her hand in her pocket , and pull out a box of comfit , luckili the salt water had not got into it , and hand them round as prize . there wa exactli one a-piec , all round . but she must have a prize herself , you know , said the mous . of cours , the dodo repli veri grave . what els have you got in your pocket he went on , turn to alic . onli a thimbl , said alic sadli . hand it over here , said the dodo . then they all crowd round her onc more , while the dodo solemnli present the thimbl , say we beg your accept of thi eleg thimbl and , when it had finish thi short speech , they all cheer . alic thought the whole thing veri absurd , but they all look so grave that she did not dare to laugh and , as she could not think of anyth to say , she simpli bow , and took the thimbl , look as solemn as she could . the next thing wa to eat the comfit thi caus some nois and confus , as the larg bird complain that they could not tast their , and the small one choke and had to be pat on the back . howev , it wa over at last , and they sat down again in a ring , and beg the mous to tell them someth more . you promis to tell me your histori , you know , said alic , and whi it is you hate—c and d , she ad in a whisper , half afraid that it would be offend again . mine is a long and a sad tale said the mous , turn to alic , and sigh . it is a long tail , certainli , said alic , look down with wonder at the mous s tail but whi do you call it sad and she kept on puzzl about it while the mous wa speak , so that her idea of the tale wa someth like this— furi said to a mous , that he met in the hous , ‘ let us both go to law i will prosecut you.—com , i ll take no denial we must have a trial for realli thi morn i ve noth to do . said the mous to the cur , ‘ such a trial , dear sir , with no juri or judg , would be wast our breath . ‘ i ll be judg , i ll be juri , said cun old furi ‘ i ll tri the whole caus , and condemn you to death . you are not attend said the mous to alic sever . what are you think of i beg your pardon , said alic veri humbl you had got to the fifth bend , i think i had not cri the mous , sharpli and veri angrili . a knot said alic , alway readi to make herself use , and look anxious about her . oh , do let me help to undo it i shall do noth of the sort , said the mous , get up and walk away . you insult me by talk such nonsens i didn t mean it plead poor alic . but you re so easili offend , you know the mous onli growl in repli . pleas come back and finish your stori alic call after it and the other all join in choru , ye , pleas do but the mous onli shook it head impati , and walk a littl quicker . what a piti it wouldn t stay sigh the lori , as soon as it wa quit out of sight and an old crab took the opportun of say to her daughter ah , my dear let thi be a lesson to you never to lose your temper hold your tongu , ma said the young crab , a littl snappishli . you re enough to tri the patienc of an oyster i wish i had our dinah here , i know i do said alic aloud , address nobodi in particular . she d soon fetch it back and who is dinah , if i might ventur to ask the question said the lori . alic repli eagerli , for she wa alway readi to talk about her pet dinah s our cat . and she s such a capit one for catch mice you can t think and oh , i wish you could see her after the bird whi , she ll eat a littl bird as soon as look at it thi speech caus a remark sensat among the parti . some of the bird hurri off at onc one old magpi began wrap itself up veri care , remark , i realli must be get home the night-air doesn t suit my throat and a canari call out in a trembl voic to it children , come away , my dear it s high time you were all in bed on variou pretext they all move off , and alic wa soon left alon . i wish i hadn t mention dinah she said to herself in a melancholi tone . nobodi seem to like her , down here , and i m sure she s the best cat in the world oh , my dear dinah i wonder if i shall ever see you ani more and here poor alic began to cri again , for she felt veri lone and low-spirit . in a littl while , howev , she again heard a littl patter of footstep in the distanc , and she look up eagerli , half hope that the mous had chang hi mind , and wa come back to finish hi stori . chapter iv . the rabbit send in a littl bill it wa the white rabbit , trot slowli back again , and look anxious about as it went , as if it had lost someth and she heard it mutter to itself the duchess the duchess oh my dear paw oh my fur and whisker she ll get me execut , as sure as ferret are ferret where can i have drop them , i wonder alic guess in a moment that it wa look for the fan and the pair of white kid glove , and she veri good-naturedli began hunt about for them , but they were nowher to be seen—everyth seem to have chang sinc her swim in the pool , and the great hall , with the glass tabl and the littl door , had vanish complet . veri soon the rabbit notic alic , as she went hunt about , and call out to her in an angri tone , whi , mari ann , what are you do out here run home thi moment , and fetch me a pair of glove and a fan quick , now and alic wa so much frighten that she ran off at onc in the direct it point to , without tri to explain the mistak it had made . he took me for hi housemaid , she said to herself as she ran . how surpris he ll be when he find out who i am but i d better take him hi fan and gloves—that is , if i can find them . as she said thi , she came upon a neat littl hous , on the door of which wa a bright brass plate with the name w. rabbit , engrav upon it . she went in without knock , and hurri upstair , in great fear lest she should meet the real mari ann , and be turn out of the hous befor she had found the fan and glove . how queer it seem , alic said to herself , to be go messag for a rabbit i suppos dinah ll be send me on messag next and she began fanci the sort of thing that would happen ‘ miss alic come here directli , and get readi for your walk ‘ come in a minut , nurs but i ve got to see that the mous doesn t get out . onli i don t think , alic went on , that they d let dinah stop in the hous if it began order peopl about like that by thi time she had found her way into a tidi littl room with a tabl in the window , and on it as she had hope a fan and two or three pair of tini white kid glove she took up the fan and a pair of the glove , and wa just go to leav the room , when her eye fell upon a littl bottl that stood near the looking-glass . there wa no label thi time with the word drink me , but nevertheless she uncork it and put it to her lip . i know someth interest is sure to happen , she said to herself , whenev i eat or drink anyth so i ll just see what thi bottl doe . i do hope it ll make me grow larg again , for realli i m quit tire of be such a tini littl thing it did so inde , and much sooner than she had expect befor she had drunk half the bottl , she found her head press against the ceil , and had to stoop to save her neck from be broken . she hastili put down the bottl , say to herself that s quit enough—i hope i shan t grow ani more—a it is , i can t get out at the door—i do wish i hadn t drunk quit so much ala it wa too late to wish that she went on grow , and grow , and veri soon had to kneel down on the floor in anoth minut there wa not even room for thi , and she tri the effect of lie down with one elbow against the door , and the other arm curl round her head . still she went on grow , and , as a last resourc , she put one arm out of the window , and one foot up the chimney , and said to herself now i can do no more , whatev happen . what will becom of me luckili for alic , the littl magic bottl had now had it full effect , and she grew no larger still it wa veri uncomfort , and , as there seem to be no sort of chanc of her ever get out of the room again , no wonder she felt unhappi . it wa much pleasant at home , thought poor alic , when one wasn t alway grow larger and smaller , and be order about by mice and rabbit . i almost wish i hadn t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and yet—it s rather curiou , you know , thi sort of life i do wonder what can have happen to me when i use to read fairy-tal , i fanci that kind of thing never happen , and now here i am in the middl of one there ought to be a book written about me , that there ought and when i grow up , i ll write one—but i m grown up now , she ad in a sorrow tone at least there s no room to grow up ani more here . but then , thought alic , shall i never get ani older than i am now that ll be a comfort , one way—nev to be an old woman—but then—alway to have lesson to learn oh , i shouldn t like that oh , you foolish alic she answer herself . how can you learn lesson in here whi , there s hardli room for you , and no room at all for ani lesson-book and so she went on , take first one side and then the other , and make quit a convers of it altogeth but after a few minut she heard a voic outsid , and stop to listen . mari ann mari ann said the voic . fetch me my glove thi moment then came a littl patter of feet on the stair . alic knew it wa the rabbit come to look for her , and she trembl till she shook the hous , quit forget that she wa now about a thousand time as larg as the rabbit , and had no reason to be afraid of it . present the rabbit came up to the door , and tri to open it but , as the door open inward , and alic s elbow wa press hard against it , that attempt prove a failur . alic heard it say to itself then i ll go round and get in at the window . that you won t thought alic , and , after wait till she fanci she heard the rabbit just under the window , she suddenli spread out her hand , and made a snatch in the air . she did not get hold of anyth , but she heard a littl shriek and a fall , and a crash of broken glass , from which she conclud that it wa just possibl it had fallen into a cucumber-fram , or someth of the sort . next came an angri voice—th rabbit s—pat pat where are you and then a voic she had never heard befor , sure then i m here dig for appl , yer honour dig for appl , inde said the rabbit angrili . here come and help me out of thi sound of more broken glass . now tell me , pat , what s that in the window sure , it s an arm , yer honour he pronounc it arrum . an arm , you goos who ever saw one that size whi , it fill the whole window sure , it doe , yer honour but it s an arm for all that . well , it s got no busi there , at ani rate go and take it away there wa a long silenc after thi , and alic could onli hear whisper now and then such as , sure , i don t like it , yer honour , at all , at all do as i tell you , you coward and at last she spread out her hand again , and made anoth snatch in the air . thi time there were two littl shriek , and more sound of broken glass . what a number of cucumber-fram there must be thought alic . i wonder what they ll do next as for pull me out of the window , i onli wish they could i m sure i don t want to stay in here ani longer she wait for some time without hear anyth more at last came a rumbl of littl cartwheel , and the sound of a good mani voic all talk togeth she made out the word where s the other ladder—whi , i hadn t to bring but one bill s got the other—bil fetch it here , lad—her , put em up at thi corner—no , tie em togeth first—they don t reach half high enough yet—oh they ll do well enough don t be particular—her , bill catch hold of thi rope—wil the roof bear—mind that loos slate—oh , it s come down head below a loud crash—now , who did that—it wa bill , i fancy—who s to go down the chimney—nay , i shan t you do it—that i won t , then—bil s to go down—her , bill the master say you re to go down the chimney oh so bill s got to come down the chimney , ha he said alic to herself . shi , they seem to put everyth upon bill i wouldn t be in bill s place for a good deal thi fireplac is narrow , to be sure but i think i can kick a littl she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could , and wait till she heard a littl anim she couldn t guess of what sort it wa scratch and scrambl about in the chimney close abov her then , say to herself thi is bill , she gave one sharp kick , and wait to see what would happen next . the first thing she heard wa a gener choru of there goe bill then the rabbit s voic along—catch him , you by the hedg then silenc , and then anoth confus of voices—hold up hi head—brandi now—don t choke him—how wa it , old fellow what happen to you tell us all about it last came a littl feebl , squeak voic , that s bill , thought alic , well , i hardli know—no more , thank ye i m better now—but i m a deal too fluster to tell you—al i know is , someth come at me like a jack-in-the-box , and up i goe like a sky-rocket so you did , old fellow said the other . we must burn the hous down said the rabbit s voic and alic call out as loud as she could , if you do , i ll set dinah at you there wa a dead silenc instantli , and alic thought to herself , i wonder what they will do next if they had ani sens , they d take the roof off . after a minut or two , they began move about again , and alic heard the rabbit say , a barrow will do , to begin with . a barrow of what thought alic but she had not long to doubt , for the next moment a shower of littl pebbl came rattl in at the window , and some of them hit her in the face . i ll put a stop to thi , she said to herself , and shout out , you d better not do that again which produc anoth dead silenc . alic notic with some surpris that the pebbl were all turn into littl cake as they lay on the floor , and a bright idea came into her head . if i eat one of these cake , she thought , it s sure to make some chang in my size and as it can t possibl make me larger , it must make me smaller , i suppos . so she swallow one of the cake , and wa delight to find that she began shrink directli . as soon as she wa small enough to get through the door , she ran out of the hous , and found quit a crowd of littl anim and bird wait outsid . the poor littl lizard , bill , wa in the middl , be held up by two guinea-pig , who were give it someth out of a bottl . they all made a rush at alic the moment she appear but she ran off as hard as she could , and soon found herself safe in a thick wood . the first thing i ve got to do , said alic to herself , as she wander about in the wood , is to grow to my right size again and the second thing is to find my way into that love garden . i think that will be the best plan . it sound an excel plan , no doubt , and veri neatli and simpli arrang the onli difficulti wa , that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it and while she wa peer about anxious among the tree , a littl sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurri . an enorm puppi wa look down at her with larg round eye , and feebli stretch out one paw , tri to touch her . poor littl thing said alic , in a coax tone , and she tri hard to whistl to it but she wa terribl frighten all the time at the thought that it might be hungri , in which case it would be veri like to eat her up in spite of all her coax . hardli know what she did , she pick up a littl bit of stick , and held it out to the puppi whereupon the puppi jump into the air off all it feet at onc , with a yelp of delight , and rush at the stick , and made believ to worri it then alic dodg behind a great thistl , to keep herself from be run over and the moment she appear on the other side , the puppi made anoth rush at the stick , and tumbl head over heel in it hurri to get hold of it then alic , think it wa veri like have a game of play with a cart-hors , and expect everi moment to be trampl under it feet , ran round the thistl again then the puppi began a seri of short charg at the stick , run a veri littl way forward each time and a long way back , and bark hoars all the while , till at last it sat down a good way off , pant , with it tongu hang out of it mouth , and it great eye half shut . thi seem to alic a good opportun for make her escap so she set off at onc , and ran till she wa quit tire and out of breath , and till the puppi s bark sound quit faint in the distanc . and yet what a dear littl puppi it wa said alic , as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself , and fan herself with one of the leav i should have like teach it trick veri much , if—if i d onli been the right size to do it oh dear i d nearli forgotten that i ve got to grow up again let me see—how is it to be manag i suppos i ought to eat or drink someth or other but the great question is , what the great question certainli wa , what alic look all round her at the flower and the blade of grass , but she did not see anyth that look like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumst . there wa a larg mushroom grow near her , about the same height as herself and when she had look under it , and on both side of it , and behind it , it occur to her that she might as well look and see what wa on the top of it . she stretch herself up on tipto , and peep over the edg of the mushroom , and her eye immedi met those of a larg blue caterpillar , that wa sit on the top with it arm fold , quietli smoke a long hookah , and take not the smallest notic of her or of anyth els . chapter v. advic from a caterpillar the caterpillar and alic look at each other for some time in silenc at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of it mouth , and address her in a languid , sleepi voic . who are you said the caterpillar . thi wa not an encourag open for a convers . alic repli , rather shyli , i—i hardli know , sir , just at present—at least i know who i wa when i got up thi morn , but i think i must have been chang sever time sinc then . what do you mean by that said the caterpillar sternli . explain yourself i can t explain myself , i m afraid , sir , said alic , becaus i m not myself , you see . i don t see , said the caterpillar . i m afraid i can t put it more clearli , alic repli veri polit , for i can t understand it myself to begin with and be so mani differ size in a day is veri confus . it isn t , said the caterpillar . well , perhap you haven t found it so yet , said alic but when you have to turn into a chrysalis—y will some day , you know—and then after that into a butterfli , i should think you ll feel it a littl queer , won t you not a bit , said the caterpillar . well , perhap your feel may be differ , said alic all i know is , it would feel veri queer to me . you said the caterpillar contemptu . who are you which brought them back again to the begin of the convers . alic felt a littl irrit at the caterpillar s make such veri short remark , and she drew herself up and said , veri

said the caterpillar . is that all said alic , swallow down her anger as well as she could . no , said the caterpillar . alic thought she might as well wait , as she had noth els to do , and perhap after all it might tell her someth worth hear . for some minut it puf away without speak , but at last it unfold it arm , took the hookah out of it mouth again , and said , so you think you re chang , do you i m afraid i am , sir , said alic i can t rememb thing as i used—and i don t keep the same size for ten minut togeth can t rememb what thing said the caterpillar . well , i ve tri to say how doth the littl busi bee , but it all came differ alic repli in a veri melancholi voic . repeat , you are old , father william , said the caterpillar . alic fold her hand , and began— you are old , father william , the young man said , and your hair ha becom veri white and yet you incessantli stand on your head— do you think , at your age , it is right in my youth , father william repli to hi

is enough , said hi father don t give yourself air do you think i can listen all day to such stuff be off , or i ll kick you down stair that is not said right , said the caterpillar . not quit right , i m afraid , said alic , timidli some of the word have got alter . it is wrong from begin to end , said the caterpillar decidedli , and there wa silenc for some minut . the caterpillar wa the first to speak . what size do you want to be it ask . oh , i m not particular as to size , alic hastili repli onli one doesn t like chang so often , you know . i don t know , said the caterpillar . alic said noth she had never been so much contradict in her life befor , and she felt that she wa lose her temper . are you content now said the caterpillar . well , i should like to be a littl larger , sir , if you wouldn t mind , said alic three inch is such a wretch height to be . it is a veri good height inde said the caterpillar angrili , rear itself upright as it spoke it wa exactli three inch high . but i m not use to it plead poor alic in a piteou tone . and she thought of herself , i wish the creatur wouldn t be so easili offend you ll get use to it in time , said the caterpillar and it put the hookah into it mouth and began smoke again . thi time alic wait patient until it chose to speak again . in a minut or two the caterpillar took the hookah out of it mouth and yawn onc or twice , and shook itself . then it got down off the mushroom , and crawl away in the grass , mere remark as it went , one side will make you grow taller , and the other side will make you grow shorter . one side of what the other side of what thought alic to herself . of the mushroom , said the caterpillar , just as if she had ask it aloud and in anoth moment it wa out of sight . alic remain look thought at the mushroom for a minut , tri to make out which were the two side of it and as it wa perfectli round , she found thi a veri difficult question . howev , at last she stretch her arm round it as far as they would go , and broke off a bit of the edg with each hand . and now which is which she said to herself , and nibbl a littl of the right-hand bit to tri the effect the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin it had struck her foot she wa a good deal frighten by thi veri sudden chang , but she felt that there wa no time to be lost , as she wa shrink rapidli so she set to work at onc to eat some of the other bit . her chin wa press so close against her foot , that there wa hardli room to open her mouth but she did it at last , and manag to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit . come , my head s free at last said alic in a tone of delight , which chang into alarm in anoth moment , when she found that her shoulder were nowher to be found all she could see , when she look down , wa an immens length of neck , which seem to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leav that lay far below her . what can all that green stuff be said alic . and where have my shoulder got to and oh , my poor hand , how is it i can t see you she wa move them about as she spoke , but no result seem to follow , except a littl shake among the distant green leav . as there seem to be no chanc of get her hand up to her head , she tri to get her head down to them , and wa delight to find that her neck would bend about easili in ani direct , like a serpent . she had just succeed in curv it down into a grace zigzag , and wa go to dive in among the leav , which she found to be noth but the top of the tree under which she had been wander , when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurri a larg pigeon had flown into her face , and wa beat her violent with it wing . serpent scream the pigeon . i m not a serpent said alic indignantli . let me alon serpent , i say again repeat the pigeon , but in a more subdu tone , and ad with a kind of sob , i ve tri everi way , and noth seem to suit them i haven t the least idea what you re talk about , said alic . i ve tri the root of tree , and i ve tri bank , and i ve tri hedg , the pigeon went on , without attend to her but those serpent there s no pleas them alic wa more and more puzzl , but she thought there wa no use in say anyth more till the pigeon had finish . as if it wasn t troubl enough hatch the egg , said the pigeon but i must be on the look-out for serpent night and day whi , i haven t had a wink of sleep these three week i m veri sorri you ve been annoy , said alic , who wa begin to see it mean . and just as i d taken the highest tree in the wood , continu the pigeon , rais it voic to a shriek , and just as i wa think i should be free of them at last , they must need come wriggl down from the sky ugh , serpent but i m not a serpent , i tell you said alic . i m a—i m a— well what are you said the pigeon . i can see you re tri to invent someth i—i m a littl girl , said alic , rather doubt , as she rememb the number of chang she had gone through that day . a like stori inde said the pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt . i ve seen a good mani littl girl in my time , but never one with such a neck as that no , no you re a serpent and there s no use deni it . i suppos you ll be tell me next that you never tast an egg i have tast egg , certainli , said alic , who wa a veri truth child but littl girl eat egg quit as much as serpent do , you know . i don t believ it , said the pigeon but if they do , whi then they re a kind of serpent , that s all i can say . thi wa such a new idea to alic , that she wa quit silent for a minut or two , which gave the pigeon the opportun of ad , you re look for egg , i know that well enough and what doe it matter to me whether you re a littl girl or a serpent it matter a good deal to me , said alic hastili but i m not look for egg , as it happen and if i wa , i shouldn t want your i don t like them raw . well , be off , then said the pigeon in a sulki tone , as it settl down again into it nest . alic crouch down among the tree as well as she could , for her neck kept get entangl among the branch , and everi now and then she had to stop and untwist it . after a while she rememb that she still held the piec of mushroom in her hand , and she set to work veri care , nibbl first at one and then at the other , and grow sometim taller and sometim shorter , until she had succeed in bring herself down to her usual height . it wa so long sinc she had been anyth near the right size , that it felt quit strang at first but she got use to it in a few minut , and began talk to herself , as usual . come , there s half my plan done now how puzzl all these chang are i m never sure what i m go to be , from one minut to anoth howev , i ve got back to my right size the next thing is , to get into that beauti garden—how is that to be done , i wonder as she said thi , she came suddenli upon an open place , with a littl hous in it about four feet high . whoever live there , thought alic , it ll never do to come upon them thi size whi , i should frighten them out of their wit so she began nibbl at the righthand bit again , and did not ventur to go near the hous till she had brought herself down to nine inch high . chapter vi . pig and pepper for a minut or two she stood look at the hous , and wonder what to do next , when suddenli a footman in liveri came run out of the wood—sh consid him to be a footman becaus he wa in liveri otherwis , judg by hi face onli , she would have call him a fish—and rap loudli at the door with hi knuckl . it wa open by anoth footman in liveri , with a round face , and larg eye like a frog and both footmen , alic notic , had powder hair that curl all over their head . she felt veri curiou to know what it wa all about , and crept a littl way out of the wood to listen . the fish-footman began by produc from under hi arm a great letter , nearli as larg as himself , and thi he hand over to the other , say , in a solemn tone , for the duchess . an invit from the queen to play croquet . the frog-footman repeat , in the same solemn tone , onli chang the order of the word a littl , from the queen . an invit for the duchess to play croquet . then they both bow low , and their curl got entangl togeth . alic laugh so much at thi , that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hear her and when she next peep out the fish-footman wa gone , and the other wa sit on the ground near the door , stare stupidli up into the sky . alic went timidli up to the door , and knock . there s no sort of use in knock , said the footman , and that for two reason . first , becaus i m on the same side of the door as you are secondli , becaus they re make such a nois insid , no one could possibl hear you . and certainli there wa a most extraordinari nois go on within—a constant howl and sneez , and everi now and then a great crash , as if a dish or kettl had been broken to piec . pleas , then , said alic , how am i to get in there might be some sens in your knock , the footman went on without attend to her , if we had the door between us . for instanc , if you were insid , you might knock , and i could let you out , you know . he wa look up into the sky all the time he wa speak , and thi alic thought decidedli uncivil . but perhap he can t help it , she said to herself hi eye are so veri nearli at the top of hi head . but at ani rate he might answer questions.—how am i to get in she repeat , aloud . i shall sit here , the footman remark , till tomorrow— at thi moment the door of the hous open , and a larg plate came skim out , straight at the footman s head it just graze hi nose , and broke to piec against one of the tree behind him . —or next day , mayb , the footman continu in the same tone , exactli as if noth had happen . how am i to get in ask alic again , in a louder tone . are you to get in at all said the footman . that s the first question , you know . it wa , no doubt onli alic did not like to be told so . it s realli dread , she mutter to herself , the way all the creatur argu . it s enough to drive one crazi the footman seem to think thi a good opportun for repeat hi remark , with variat . i shall sit here , he said , on and off , for day and day . but what am i to do said alic . anyth you like , said the footman , and began whistl . oh , there s no use in talk to him , said alic desper he s perfectli idiot and she open the door and went in . the door led right into a larg kitchen , which wa full of smoke from one end to the other the duchess wa sit on a three-leg stool in the middl , nurs a babi the cook wa lean over the fire , stir a larg cauldron which seem to be full of soup . there s certainli too much pepper in that soup alic said to herself , as well as she could for sneez . there wa certainli too much of it in the air . even the duchess sneez occasion and as for the babi , it wa sneez and howl altern without a moment s paus . the onli thing in the kitchen that did not sneez , were the cook , and a larg cat which wa sit on the hearth and grin from ear to ear . pleas would you tell me , said alic , a littl timidli , for she wa not quit sure whether it wa good manner for her to speak first , whi your cat grin like that it s a cheshir cat , said the duchess , and that s whi . pig she said the last word with such sudden violenc that alic quit jump but she saw in anoth moment that it wa address to the babi , and not to her , so she took courag , and went on again— i didn t know that cheshir cat alway grin in fact , i didn t know that cat could grin . they all can , said the duchess and most of em do . i don t know of ani that do , alic said veri polit , feel quit pleas to have got into a convers . you don t know much , said the duchess and that s a fact . alic did not at all like the tone of thi remark , and thought it would be as well to introduc some other subject of convers . while she wa tri to fix on one , the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire , and at onc set to work throw everyth within her reach at the duchess and the baby—th fire-iron came first then follow a shower of saucepan , plate , and dish . the duchess took no notic of them even when they hit her and the babi wa howl so much alreadi , that it wa quit imposs to say whether the blow hurt it or not . oh , pleas mind what you re do cri alic , jump up and down in an agoni of terror . oh , there goe hi preciou nose as an unusu larg saucepan flew close by it , and veri nearli carri it off . if everybodi mind their own busi , the duchess said in a hoars growl , the world would go round a deal faster than it doe . which would not be an advantag , said alic , who felt veri glad to get an opportun of show off a littl of her knowledg . just think of what work it would make with the day and night you see the earth take twenty-four hour to turn round on it axis— talk of axe , said the duchess , chop off her head alic glanc rather anxious at the cook , to see if she meant to take the hint but the cook wa busili stir the soup , and seem not to be listen , so she went on again twenty-four hour , i think or is it twelv i— oh , don t bother me , said the duchess i never could abid figur and with that she began nurs her child again , sing a sort of lullabi to it as she did so , and give it a violent shake at the end of everi line speak roughli to your littl boy , and beat him when he sneez he onli doe it to annoy , becaus he know it teas . choru . in which the cook and the babi join wow wow wow while the duchess sang the second vers of the song , she kept toss the babi violent up and down , and the poor littl thing howl so , that alic could hardli hear the words— i speak sever to my boy , i beat him when he sneez for he can thoroughli enjoy the pepper when he pleas choru . wow wow wow here you may nurs it a bit , if you like the duchess said to alic , fling the babi at her as she spoke . i must go and get readi to play croquet with the queen , and she hurri out of the room . the cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out , but it just miss her . alic caught the babi with some difficulti , as it wa a queer-shap littl creatur , and held out it arm and leg in all direct , just like a star-fish , thought alic . the poor littl thing wa snort like a steam-engin when she caught it , and kept doubl itself up and straighten itself out again , so that altogeth , for the first minut or two , it wa as much as she could do to hold it . as soon as she had made out the proper way of nurs it , which wa to twist it up into a sort of knot , and then keep tight hold of it right ear and left foot , so as to prevent it undo itself , she carri it out into the open air . if i don t take thi child away with me , thought alic , they re sure to kill it in a day or two wouldn t it be murder to leav it behind she said the last word out loud , and the littl thing grunt in repli it had left off sneez by thi time . don t grunt , said alic that s not at all a proper way of express yourself . the babi grunt again , and alic look veri anxious into it face to see what wa the matter with it . there could be no doubt that it had a veri turn-up nose , much more like a snout than a real nose also it eye were get extrem small for a babi altogeth alic did not like the look of the thing at all . but perhap it wa onli sob , she thought , and look into it eye again , to see if there were ani tear . no , there were no tear . if you re go to turn into a pig , my dear , said alic , serious , i ll have noth more to do with you . mind now the poor littl thing sob again or grunt , it wa imposs to say which , and they went on for some while in silenc . alic wa just begin to think to herself , now , what am i to do with thi creatur when i get it home when it grunt again , so violent , that she look down into it face in some alarm . thi time there could be no mistak about it it wa neither more nor less than a pig , and she felt that it would be quit absurd for her to carri it further . so she set the littl creatur down , and felt quit reliev to see it trot away quietli into the wood . if it had grown up , she said to herself , it would have made a dread ugli child but it make rather a handsom pig , i think . and she began think over other children she knew , who might do veri well as pig , and wa just say to herself , if one onli knew the right way to chang them— when she wa a littl startl by see the cheshir cat sit on a bough of a tree a few yard off . the cat onli grin when it saw alic . it look good-natur , she thought still it had veri long claw and a great mani teeth , so she felt that it ought to be treat with respect . cheshir puss , she began , rather timidli , as she did not at all know whether it would like the name howev , it onli grin a littl wider . come , it s pleas so far , thought alic , and she went on . would you tell me , pleas , which way i ought to go from here that depend a good deal on where you want to get to , said the cat . i don t much care where— said alic . then it doesn t matter which way you go , said the cat . —so long as i get somewher , alic ad as an explan . oh , you re sure to do that , said the cat , if you onli walk long enough . alic felt that thi could not be deni , so she tri anoth question . what sort of peopl live about here in that direct , the cat said , wave it right paw round , live a hatter and in that direct , wave the other paw , live a march hare . visit either you like they re both mad . but i don t want to go among mad peopl , alic remark . oh , you can t help that , said the cat we re all mad here . i m mad . you re mad . how do you know i m mad said alic . you must be , said the cat , or you wouldn t have come here . alic didn t think that prove it at all howev , she went on and how do you know that you re mad to begin with , said the cat , a dog s not mad . you grant that i suppos so , said alic . well , then , the cat went on , you see , a dog growl when it s angri , and wag it tail when it s pleas . now i growl when i m pleas , and wag my tail when i m angri . therefor i m mad . i call it pur , not growl , said alic . call it what you like , said the cat . do you play croquet with the queen to-day i should like it veri much , said alic , but i haven t been invit yet . you ll see me there , said the cat , and vanish . alic wa not much surpris at thi , she wa get so use to queer thing happen . while she wa look at the place where it had been , it suddenli appear again . by-the-by , what becam of the babi said the cat . i d nearli forgotten to ask . it turn into a pig , alic quietli said , just as if it had come back in a natur way . i thought it would , said the cat , and vanish again . alic wait a littl , half expect to see it again , but it did not appear , and after a minut or two she walk on in the direct in which the march hare wa said to live . i ve seen hatter befor , she said to herself the march hare will be much the most interest , and perhap as thi is may it won t be rave mad—at least not so mad as it wa in march . as she said thi , she look up , and there wa the cat again , sit on a branch of a tree . did you say pig , or fig said the cat . i said pig , repli alic and i wish you wouldn t keep appear and vanish so suddenli you make one quit giddi . all right , said the cat and thi time it vanish quit slowli , begin with the end of the tail , and end with the grin , which remain some time after the rest of it had gone . well i ve often seen a cat without a grin , thought alic but a grin without a cat it s the most curiou thing i ever saw in my life she had not gone much farther befor she came in sight of the hous of the march hare she thought it must be the right hous , becaus the chimney were shape like ear and the roof wa thatch with fur . it wa so larg a hous , that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbl some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom , and rais herself to about two feet high even then she walk up toward it rather timidli , say to herself suppos it should be rave mad after all i almost wish i d gone to see the hatter instead chapter vii . a mad tea-parti there wa a tabl set out under a tree in front of the hous , and the march hare and the hatter were have tea at it a dormous wa sit between them , fast asleep , and the other two were use it as a cushion , rest their elbow on it , and talk over it head . veri uncomfort for the dormous , thought alic onli , as it s asleep , i suppos it doesn t mind . the tabl wa a larg one , but the three were all crowd togeth at one corner of it no room no room they cri out when they saw alic come . there s plenti of room said alic indignantli , and she sat down in a larg arm-chair at one end of the tabl . have some wine , the march hare said in an encourag tone . alic look all round the tabl , but there wa noth on it but tea . i don t see ani wine , she remark . there isn t ani , said the march hare . then it wasn t veri civil of you to offer it , said alic angrili . it wasn t veri civil of you to sit down without be invit , said the march hare . i didn t know it wa your tabl , said alic it s laid for a great mani more than three . your hair want cut , said the hatter . he had been look at alic for some time with great curios , and thi wa hi first speech . you should learn not to make person remark , alic said with some sever it s veri rude . the hatter open hi eye veri wide on hear thi but all he said wa , whi is a raven like a writing-desk come , we shall have some fun now thought alic . i m glad they ve begun ask riddles.—i believ i can guess that , she ad aloud . do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it said the march hare . exactli so , said alic . then you should say what you mean , the march hare went on . i do , alic hastili repli at least—at least i mean what i say—that s the same thing , you know . not the same thing a bit said the hatter . you might just as well say that ‘ i see what i eat is the same thing as ‘ i eat what i see you might just as well say , ad the march hare , that ‘ i like what i get is the same thing as ‘ i get what i like you might just as well say , ad the dormous , who seem to be talk in hi sleep , that ‘ i breath when i sleep is the same thing as ‘ i sleep when i breath it is the same thing with you , said the hatter , and here the convers drop , and the parti sat silent for a minut , while alic thought over all she could rememb about raven and writing-desk , which wasn t much . the hatter wa the first to break the silenc . what day of the month is it he said , turn to alic he had taken hi watch out of hi pocket , and wa look at it uneasili , shake it everi now and then , and hold it to hi ear . alic consid a littl , and then said the fourth . two day wrong sigh the hatter . i told you butter wouldn t suit the work he ad look angrili at the march hare . it wa the best butter , the march hare meekli repli . ye , but some crumb must have got in as well , the hatter grumbl you shouldn t have put it in with the bread-knif . the march hare took the watch and look at it gloomili then he dip it into hi cup of tea , and look at it again but he could think of noth better to say than hi first remark , it wa the best butter , you know . alic had been look over hi shoulder with some curios . what a funni watch she remark . it tell the day of the month , and doesn t tell what o clock it is whi should it mutter the hatter . doe your watch tell you what year it is of cours not , alic repli veri readili but that s becaus it stay the same year for such a long time togeth . which is just the case with mine , said the hatter . alic felt dread puzzl . the hatter s remark seem to have no sort of mean in it , and yet it wa certainli english . i don t quit understand you , she said , as polit as she could . the dormous is asleep again , said the hatter , and he pour a littl hot tea upon it nose . the dormous shook it head impati , and said , without open it eye , of cours , of cours just what i wa go to remark myself . have you guess the riddl yet the hatter said , turn to alic again . no , i give it up , alic repli what s the answer i haven t the slightest idea , said the hatter . nor i , said the march hare . alic sigh wearili . i think you might do someth better with the time , she said , than wast it in ask riddl that have no answer . if you knew time as well as i do , said the hatter , you wouldn t talk about wast it . it s him . i don t know what you mean , said alic . of cours you don t the hatter said , toss hi head contemptu . i dare say you never even spoke to time perhap not , alic cautious repli but i know i have to beat time when i learn music . ah that account for it , said the hatter . he won t stand beat . now , if you onli kept on good term with him , he d do almost anyth you like with the clock . for instanc , suppos it were nine o clock in the morn , just time to begin lesson you d onli have to whisper a hint to time , and round goe the clock in a twinkl half-past one , time for dinner i onli wish it wa , the march hare said to itself in a whisper . that would be grand , certainli , said alic thought but then—i shouldn t be hungri for it , you know . not at first , perhap , said the hatter but you could keep it to half-past one as long as you like . is that the way you manag alic ask . the hatter shook hi head mourn . not i he repli . we quarrel last march—just befor he went mad , you know— point with hi tea spoon at the march hare , —it wa at the great concert given by the queen of heart , and i had to sing ‘ twinkl , twinkl , littl bat how i wonder what you re at you know the song , perhap i ve heard someth like it , said alic . it goe on , you know , the hatter continu , in thi way— ‘ up abov the world you fli , like a tea-tray in the sky . twinkl , twinkle— here the dormous shook itself , and began sing in it sleep twinkl , twinkl , twinkl , twinkle— and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop . well , i d hardli finish the first vers , said the hatter , when the queen jump up and bawl out , ‘ he s murder the time off with hi head how dread savag exclaim alic . and ever sinc that , the hatter went on in a mourn tone , he won t do a thing i ask it s alway six o clock now . a bright idea came into alic s head . is that the reason so mani tea-th are put out here she ask . ye , that s it , said the hatter with a sigh it s alway tea-tim , and we ve no time to wash the thing between while . then you keep move round , i suppos said alic . exactli so , said the hatter as the thing get use up . but what happen when you come to the begin again alic ventur to ask . suppos we chang the subject , the march hare interrupt , yawn . i m get tire of thi . i vote the young ladi tell us a stori . i m afraid i don t know one , said alic , rather alarm at the propos . then the dormous shall they both cri . wake up , dormous and they pinch it on both side at onc . the dormous slowli open hi eye . i wasn t asleep , he said in a hoars , feebl voic i heard everi word you fellow were say . tell us a stori said the march hare . ye , pleas do plead alic . and be quick about it , ad the hatter , or you ll be asleep again befor it s done . onc upon a time there were three littl sister , the dormous began in a great hurri and their name were elsi , laci , and tilli and they live at the bottom of a well— what did they live on said alic , who alway took a great interest in question of eat and drink . they live on treacl , said the dormous , after think a minut or two . they couldn t have done that , you know , alic gentli remark they d have been ill . so they were , said the dormous veri ill. alic tri to fanci to herself what such an extraordinari way of live would be like , but it puzzl her too much , so she went on but whi did they live at the bottom of a well take some more tea , the march hare said to alic , veri earnestli . i ve had noth yet , alic repli in an offend tone , so i can t take more . you mean you can t take less , said the hatter it s veri easi to take more than noth . nobodi ask your opinion , said alic . who s make person remark now the hatter ask triumphantli . alic did not quit know what to say to thi so she help herself to some tea and bread-and-butt , and then turn to the dormous , and repeat her question . whi did they live at the bottom of a well the dormous again took a minut or two to think about it , and then said , it wa a treacle-wel . there s no such thing alic wa begin veri angrili , but the hatter and the march hare went sh sh and the dormous sulkili remark , if you can t be civil , you d better finish the stori for yourself . no , pleas go on alic said veri humbl i won t interrupt again . i dare say there may be one . one , inde said the dormous indignantli . howev , he consent to go on . and so these three littl sisters—they were learn to draw , you know— what did they draw said alic , quit forget her promis . treacl , said the dormous , without consid at all thi time . i want a clean cup , interrupt the hatter let s all move one place on . he move on as he spoke , and the dormous follow him the march hare move into the dormous s place , and alic rather unwillingli took the place of the march hare . the hatter wa the onli one who got ani advantag from the chang and alic wa a good deal wors off than befor , as the march hare had just upset the milk-jug into hi plate . alic did not wish to offend the dormous again , so she began veri cautious but i don t understand . where did they draw the treacl from you can draw water out of a water-wel , said the hatter so i should think you could draw treacl out of a treacle-well—eh , stupid but they were in the well , alic said to the dormous , not choos to notic thi last remark . of cours they were , said the dormous —well in . thi answer so confus poor alic , that she let the dormous go on for some time without interrupt it . they were learn to draw , the dormous went on , yawn and rub it eye , for it wa get veri sleepi and they drew all manner of things—everyth that begin with an m— whi with an m said alic . whi not said the march hare . alic wa silent . the dormous had close it eye by thi time , and wa go off into a doze but , on be pinch by the hatter , it woke up again with a littl shriek , and went on —that begin with an m , such as mouse-trap , and the moon , and memori , and muchness—y know you say thing are much of a muchness—did you ever see such a thing as a draw of a much realli , now you ask me , said alic , veri much confus , i don t think— then you shouldn t talk , said the hatter . thi piec of rude wa more than alic could bear she got up in great disgust , and walk off the dormous fell asleep instantli , and neither of the other took the least notic of her go , though she look back onc or twice , half hope that they would call after her the last time she saw them , they were tri to put the dormous into the teapot . at ani rate i ll never go there again said alic as she pick her way through the wood . it s the stupidest tea-parti i ever wa at in all my life just as she said thi , she notic that one of the tree had a door lead right into it . that s veri curiou she thought . but everyth s curiou today . i think i may as well go in at onc . and in she went . onc more she found herself in the long hall , and close to the littl glass tabl . now , i ll manag better thi time , she said to herself , and began by take the littl golden key , and unlock the door that led into the garden . then she went to work nibbl at the mushroom she had kept a piec of it in her pocket till she wa about a foot high then she walk down the littl passag and then—sh found herself at last in the beauti garden , among the bright flower-b and the cool fountain . chapter viii . the queen s croquet-ground a larg rose-tre stood near the entranc of the garden the rose grow on it were white , but there were three garden at it , busili paint them red . alic thought thi a veri curiou thing , and she went nearer to watch them , and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say , look out now , five don t go splash paint over me like that i couldn t help it , said five , in a sulki tone seven jog my elbow . on which seven look up and said , that s right , five alway lay the blame on other you d better not talk said five . i heard the queen say onli yesterday you deserv to be behead what for said the one who had spoken first . that s none of your busi , two said seven . ye , it is hi busi said five , and i ll tell him—it wa for bring the cook tulip-root instead of onion . seven flung down hi brush , and had just begun well , of all the unjust things— when hi eye chanc to fall upon alic , as she stood watch them , and he check himself suddenli the other look round also , and all of them bow low . would you tell me , said alic , a littl timidli , whi you are paint those rose five and seven said noth , but look at two . two began in a low voic , whi the fact is , you see , miss , thi here ought to have been a red rose-tre , and we put a white one in by mistak and if the queen wa to find it out , we should all have our head cut off , you know . so you see , miss , we re do our best , afor she come , to— at thi moment five , who had been anxious look across the garden , call out the queen the queen and the three garden instantli threw themselv flat upon their face . there wa a sound of mani footstep , and alic look round , eager to see the queen . first came ten soldier carri club these were all shape like the three garden , oblong and flat , with their hand and feet at the corner next the ten courtier these were ornament all over with diamond , and walk two and two , as the soldier did . after these came the royal children there were ten of them , and the littl dear came jump merrili along hand in hand , in coupl they were all ornament with heart . next came the guest , mostli king and queen , and among them alic recognis the white rabbit it wa talk in a hurri nervou manner , smile at everyth that wa said , and went by without notic her . then follow the knave of heart , carri the king s crown on a crimson velvet cushion and , last of all thi grand process , came the king and queen of heart . alic wa rather doubt whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three garden , but she could not rememb ever have heard of such a rule at process and besid , what would be the use of a process , thought she , if peopl had all to lie down upon their face , so that they couldn t see it so she stood still where she wa , and wait . when the process came opposit to alic , they all stop and look at her , and the queen said sever who is thi she said it to the knave of heart , who onli bow and smile in repli . idiot said the queen , toss her head impati and , turn to alic , she went on , what s your name , child my name is alic , so pleas your majesti , said alic veri polit but she ad , to herself , whi , they re onli a pack of card , after all . i needn t be afraid of them and who are these said the queen , point to the three garden who were lie round the rose-tre for , you see , as they were lie on their face , and the pattern on their back wa the same as the rest of the pack , she could not tell whether they were garden , or soldier , or courtier , or three of her own children . how should i know said alic , surpris at her own courag . it s no busi of mine . the queen turn crimson with furi , and , after glare at her for a moment like a wild beast , scream off with her head off— nonsens said alic , veri loudli and decidedli , and the queen wa silent . the king laid hi hand upon her arm , and timidli said consid , my dear she is onli a child the queen turn angrili away from him , and said to the knave turn them over the knave did so , veri care , with one foot . get up said the queen , in a shrill , loud voic , and the three garden instantli jump up , and began bow to the king , the queen , the royal children , and everybodi els . leav off that scream the queen . you make me giddi . and then , turn to the rose-tre , she went on , what have you been do here may it pleas your majesti , said two , in a veri humbl tone , go down on one knee as he spoke , we were trying— i see said the queen , who had meanwhil been examin the rose . off with their head and the process move on , three of the soldier remain behind to execut the unfortun garden , who ran to alic for protect . you shan t be behead said alic , and she put them into a larg flower-pot that stood near . the three soldier wander about for a minut or two , look for them , and then quietli march off after the other . are their head off shout the queen . their head are gone , if it pleas your majesti the soldier shout in repli . that s right shout the queen . can you play croquet the soldier were silent , and look at alic , as the question wa evid meant for her . ye shout alic . come on , then roar the queen , and alic join the process , wonder veri much what would happen next . it s—it s a veri fine day said a timid voic at her side . she wa walk by the white rabbit , who wa peep anxious into her face . veri , said alic —where s the duchess hush hush said the rabbit in a low , hurri tone . he look anxious over hi shoulder as he spoke , and then rais himself upon tipto , put hi mouth close to her ear , and whisper she s under sentenc of execut . what for said alic . did you say ‘ what a piti the rabbit ask . no , i didn t , said alic i don t think it s at all a piti . i said ‘ what for she box the queen s ears— the rabbit began . alic gave a littl scream of laughter . oh , hush the rabbit whisper in a frighten tone . the queen will hear you you see , she came rather late , and the queen said— get to your place shout the queen in a voic of thunder , and peopl began run about in all direct , tumbl up against each other howev , they got settl down in a minut or two , and the game began . alic thought she had never seen such a curiou croquet-ground in her life it wa all ridg and furrow the ball were live hedgehog , the mallet live flamingo , and the soldier had to doubl themselv up and to stand on their hand and feet , to make the arch . the chief difficulti alic found at first wa in manag her flamingo she succeed in get it bodi tuck away , comfort enough , under her arm , with it leg hang down , but gener , just as she had got it neck nice straighten out , and wa go to give the hedgehog a blow with it head , it would twist itself round and look up in her face , with such a puzzl express that she could not help burst out laugh and when she had got it head down , and wa go to begin again , it wa veri provok to find that the hedgehog had unrol itself , and wa in the act of crawl away besid all thi , there wa gener a ridg or furrow in the way wherev she want to send the hedgehog to , and , as the doubled-up soldier were alway get up and walk off to other part of the ground , alic soon came to the conclus that it wa a veri difficult game inde . the player all play at onc without wait for turn , quarrel all the while , and fight for the hedgehog and in a veri short time the queen wa in a furiou passion , and went stamp about , and shout off with hi head or off with her head about onc in a minut . alic began to feel veri uneasi to be sure , she had not as yet had ani disput with the queen , but she knew that it might happen ani minut , and then , thought she , what would becom of me they re dread fond of behead peopl here the great wonder is , that there s ani one left aliv she wa look about for some way of escap , and wonder whether she could get away without be seen , when she notic a curiou appear in the air it puzzl her veri much at first , but , after watch it a minut or two , she made it out to be a grin , and she said to herself it s the cheshir cat now i shall have somebodi to talk to . how are you get on said the cat , as soon as there wa mouth enough for it to speak with . alic wait till the eye appear , and then nod . it s no use speak to it , she thought , till it ear have come , or at least one of them . in anoth minut the whole head appear , and then alic put down her flamingo , and began an account of the game , feel veri glad she had someon to listen to her . the cat seem to think that there wa enough of it now in sight , and no more of it appear . i don t think they play at all fairli , alic began , in rather a complain tone , and they all quarrel so dread one can t hear oneself speak—and they don t seem to have ani rule in particular at least , if there are , nobodi attend to them—and you ve no idea how confus it is all the thing be aliv for instanc , there s the arch i ve got to go through next walk about at the other end of the ground—and i should have croquet the queen s hedgehog just now , onli it ran away when it saw mine come how do you like the queen said the cat in a low voic . not at all , said alic she s so extremely— just then she notic that the queen wa close behind her , listen so she went on , —like to win , that it s hardli worth while finish the game . the queen smile and pass on . who are you talk to said the king , go up to alic , and look at the cat s head with great curios . it s a friend of mine—a cheshir cat , said alic allow me to introduc it . i don t like the look of it at all , said the king howev , it may kiss my hand if it like . i d rather not , the cat remark . don t be impertin , said the king , and don t look at me like that he got behind alic as he spoke . a cat may look at a king , said alic . i ve read that in some book , but i don t rememb where . well , it must be remov , said the king veri decidedli , and he call the queen , who wa pass at the moment , my dear i wish you would have thi cat remov the queen had onli one way of settl all difficulti , great or small . off with hi head she said , without even look round . i ll fetch the execution myself , said the king eagerli , and he hurri off . alic thought she might as well go back , and see how the game wa go on , as she heard the queen s voic in the distanc , scream with passion . she had alreadi heard her sentenc three of the player to be execut for have miss their turn , and she did not like the look of thing at all , as the game wa in such confus that she never knew whether it wa her turn or not . so she went in search of her hedgehog . the hedgehog wa engag in a fight with anoth hedgehog , which seem to alic an excel opportun for croquet one of them with the other the onli difficulti wa , that her flamingo wa gone across to the other side of the garden , where alic could see it tri in a helpless sort of way to fli up into a tree . by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back , the fight wa over , and both the hedgehog were out of sight but it doesn t matter much , thought alic , as all the arch are gone from thi side of the ground . so she tuck it away under her arm , that it might not escap again , and went back for a littl more convers with her friend . when she got back to the cheshir cat , she wa surpris to find quit a larg crowd collect round it there wa a disput go on between the execution , the king , and the queen , who were all talk at onc , while all the rest were quit silent , and look veri uncomfort . the moment alic appear , she wa appeal to by all three to settl the question , and they repeat their argument to her , though , as they all spoke at onc , she found it veri hard inde to make out exactli what they said . the execution s argument wa , that you couldn t cut off a head unless there wa a bodi to cut it off from that he had never had to do such a thing befor , and he wasn t go to begin at hi time of life . the king s argument wa , that anyth that had a head could be behead , and that you weren t to talk nonsens . the queen s argument wa , that if someth wasn t done about it in less than no time she d have everybodi execut , all round . it wa thi last remark that had made the whole parti look so grave and anxiou . alic could think of noth els to say but it belong to the duchess you d better ask her about it . she s in prison , the queen said to the execution fetch her here . and the execution went off like an arrow . the cat s head began fade away the moment he wa gone , and , by the time he had come back with the duchess , it had entir disappear so the king and the execution ran wildli up and down look for it , while the rest of the parti went back to the game . chapter ix . the mock turtl s stori you can t think how glad i am to see you again , you dear old thing said the duchess , as she tuck her arm affection into alic s , and they walk off togeth . alic wa veri glad to find her in such a pleasant temper , and thought to herself that perhap it wa onli the pepper that had made her so savag when they met in the kitchen . when i m a duchess , she said to herself , not in a veri hope tone though , i won t have ani pepper in my kitchen at all . soup doe veri well without—mayb it s alway pepper that make peopl hot-temp , she went on , veri much pleas at have found out a new kind of rule , and vinegar that make them sour—and camomil that make them bitter—and—and barley-sugar and such thing that make children sweet-temp . i onli wish peopl knew that then they wouldn t be so stingi about it , you know— she had quit forgotten the duchess by thi time , and wa a littl startl when she heard her voic close to her ear . you re think about someth , my dear , and that make you forget to talk . i can t tell you just now what the moral of that is , but i shall rememb it in a bit . perhap it hasn t one , alic ventur to remark . tut , tut , child said the duchess . everyth s got a moral , if onli you can find it . and she squeez herself up closer to alic s side as she spoke . alic did not much like keep so close to her first , becaus the duchess wa veri ugli and secondli , becaus she wa exactli the right height to rest her chin upon alic s shoulder , and it wa an uncomfort sharp chin . howev , she did not like to be rude , so she bore it as well as she could . the game s go on rather better now , she said , by way of keep up the convers a littl . ti so , said the duchess and the moral of that is— ‘ oh , ti love , ti love , that make the world go round somebodi said , alic whisper , that it s done by everybodi mind their own busi ah , well it mean much the same thing , said the duchess , dig her sharp littl chin into alic s shoulder as she ad , and the moral of that is— ‘ take care of the sens , and the sound will take care of themselv . how fond she is of find moral in thing alic thought to herself . i dare say you re wonder whi i don t put my arm round your waist , the duchess said after a paus the reason is , that i m doubt about the temper of your flamingo . shall i tri the experi he might bite , alic cautious repli , not feel at all anxiou to have the experi tri . veri true , said the duchess flamingo and mustard both bite . and the moral of that is— ‘ bird of a feather flock togeth . onli mustard isn t a bird , alic remark . right , as usual , said the duchess what a clear way you have of put thing it s a miner , i think , said alic . of cours it is , said the duchess , who seem readi to agre to everyth that alic said there s a larg mustard-min near here . and the moral of that is— ‘ the more there is of mine , the less there is of your . oh , i know exclaim alic , who had not attend to thi last remark , it s a veget . it doesn t look like one , but it is . i quit agre with you , said the duchess and the moral of that is— ‘ be what you would seem to be —or if you d like it put more simply— ‘ never imagin yourself not to be otherwis than what it might appear to other that what you were or might have been wa not otherwis than what you had been would have appear to them to be otherwis . i think i should understand that better , alic said veri polit , if i had it written down but i can t quit follow it as you say it . that s noth to what i could say if i chose , the duchess repli , in a pleas tone . pray don t troubl yourself to say it ani longer than that , said alic . oh , don t talk about troubl said the duchess . i make you a present of everyth i ve said as yet . a cheap sort of present thought alic . i m glad they don t give birthday present like that but she did not ventur to say it out loud . think again the duchess ask , with anoth dig of her sharp littl chin . i ve a right to think , said alic sharpli , for she wa begin to feel a littl worri . just about as much right , said the duchess , as pig have to fli and the m— but here , to alic s great surpris , the duchess s voic die away , even in the middl of her favourit word ‘ moral , and the arm that wa link into her began to trembl . alic look up , and there stood the queen in front of them , with her arm fold , frown like a thunderstorm . a fine day , your majesti the duchess began in a low , weak voic . now , i give you fair warn , shout the queen , stamp on the ground as she spoke either you or your head must be off , and that in about half no time take your choic the duchess took her choic , and wa gone in a moment . let s go on with the game , the queen said to alic and alic wa too much frighten to say a word , but slowli follow her back to the croquet-ground . the other guest had taken advantag of the queen s absenc , and were rest in the shade howev , the moment they saw her , they hurri back to the game , the queen mere remark that a moment s delay would cost them their live . all the time they were play the queen never left off quarrel with the other player , and shout off with hi head or off with her head those whom she sentenc were taken into custodi by the soldier , who of cours had to leav off be arch to do thi , so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arch left , and all the player , except the king , the queen , and alic , were in custodi and under sentenc of execut . then the queen left off , quit out of breath , and said to alic , have you seen the mock turtl yet no , said alic . i don t even know what a mock turtl is . it s the thing mock turtl soup is made from , said the queen . i never saw one , or heard of one , said alic . come on , then , said the queen , and he shall tell you hi histori , as they walk off togeth , alic heard the king say in a low voic , to the compani gener , you are all pardon . come , that s a good thing she said to herself , for she had felt quit unhappi at the number of execut the queen had order . they veri soon came upon a gryphon , lie fast asleep in the sun . if you don t know what a gryphon is , look at the pictur . up , lazi thing said the queen , and take thi young ladi to see the mock turtl , and to hear hi histori . i must go back and see after some execut i have order and she walk off , leav alic alon with the gryphon . alic did not quit like the look of the creatur , but on the whole she thought it would be quit as safe to stay with it as to go after that savag queen so she wait . the gryphon sat up and rub it eye then it watch the queen till she wa out of sight then it chuckl . what fun said the gryphon , half to itself , half to alic . what is the fun said alic . whi , she , said the gryphon . it s all her fanci , that they never execut nobodi , you know . come on everybodi say ‘ come on here , thought alic , as she went slowli after it i never wa so order about in all my life , never they had not gone far befor they saw the mock turtl in the distanc , sit sad and lone on a littl ledg of rock , and , as they came nearer , alic could hear him sigh as if hi heart would break . she piti him deepli . what is hi sorrow she ask the gryphon , and the gryphon answer , veri nearli in the same word as befor , it s all hi fanci , that he hasn t got no sorrow , you know . come on so they went up to the mock turtl , who look at them with larg eye full of tear , but said noth . thi here young ladi , said the gryphon , she want for to know your histori , she do . i ll tell it her , said the mock turtl in a deep , hollow tone sit down , both of you , and don t speak a word till i ve finish . so they sat down , and nobodi spoke for some minut . alic thought to herself , i don t see how he can ever finish , if he doesn t begin . but she wait patient . onc , said the mock turtl at last , with a deep sigh , i wa a real turtl . these word were follow by a veri long silenc , broken onli by an occasion exclam of hjckrrh from the gryphon , and the constant heavi sob of the mock turtl . alic wa veri nearli get up and say , thank you , sir , for your interest stori , but she could not help think there must be more to come , so she sat still and said noth . when we were littl , the mock turtl went on at last , more calmli , though still sob a littl now and then , we went to school in the sea . the master wa an old turtle—w use to call him tortoise— whi did you call him tortois , if he wasn t one alic ask . we call him tortois becaus he taught us , said the mock turtl angrili realli you are veri dull you ought to be asham of yourself for ask such a simpl question , ad the gryphon and then they both sat silent and look at poor alic , who felt readi to sink into the earth . at last the gryphon said to the mock turtl , drive on , old fellow don t be all day about it and he went on in these word ye , we went to school in the sea , though you mayn t believ it— i never said i didn t interrupt alic . you did , said the mock turtl . hold your tongu ad the gryphon , befor alic could speak again . the mock turtl went on . we had the best of educations—in fact , we went to school everi day— i ve been to a day-school , too , said alic you needn t be so proud as all that . with extra ask the mock turtl a littl anxious . ye , said alic , we learn french and music . and wash said the mock turtl . certainli not said alic indignantli . ah then your wasn t a realli good school , said the mock turtl in a tone of great relief . now at our they had at the end of the bill , ‘ french , music , and washing—extra . you couldn t have want it much , said alic live at the bottom of the sea . i couldn t afford to learn it . said the mock turtl with a sigh . i onli took the regular cours . what wa that inquir alic . reel and writh , of cours , to begin with , the mock turtl repli and then the differ branch of arithmetic—ambit , distract , uglif , and deris . i never heard of ‘ uglif , alic ventur to say . what is it the gryphon lift up both it paw in surpris . what never heard of uglifi it exclaim . you know what to beautifi is , i suppos ye , said alic doubt it means—to—make—anything—pretti . well , then , the gryphon went on , if you don t know what to uglifi is , you are a simpleton . alic did not feel encourag to ask ani more question about it , so she turn to the mock turtl , and said what els had you to learn well , there wa mysteri , the mock turtl repli , count off the subject on hi flapper , —mysteri , ancient and modern , with seaographi then drawling—th drawling-mast wa an old conger-eel , that use to come onc a week he taught us drawl , stretch , and faint in coil . what wa that like said alic . well , i can t show it you myself , the mock turtl said i m too stiff . and the gryphon never learnt it . hadn t time , said the gryphon i went to the classic master , though . he wa an old crab , he wa . i never went to him , the mock turtl said with a sigh he taught laugh and grief , they use to say . so he did , so he did , said the gryphon , sigh in hi turn and both creatur hid their face in their paw . and how mani hour a day did you do lesson said alic , in a hurri to chang the subject . ten hour the first day , said the mock turtl nine the next , and so on . what a curiou plan exclaim alic . that s the reason they re call lesson , the gryphon remark becaus they lessen from day to day . thi wa quit a new idea to alic , and she thought it over a littl befor she made her next remark . then the eleventh day must have been a holiday of cours it wa , said the mock turtl . and how did you manag on the twelfth alic went on eagerli . that s enough about lesson , the gryphon interrupt in a veri decid tone tell her someth about the game now . chapter x . the lobster quadril the mock turtl sigh deepli , and drew the back of one flapper across hi eye . he look at alic , and tri to speak , but for a minut or two sob choke hi voic . same as if he had a bone in hi throat , said the gryphon and it set to work shake him and punch him in the back . at last the mock turtl recov hi voic , and , with tear run down hi cheek , he went on again— you may not have live much under the sea— i haven t , said alice—and perhap you were never even introduc to a lobster— alic began to say i onc tasted— but check herself hastili , and said no , never —so you can have no idea what a delight thing a lobster quadril is no , inde , said alic . what sort of a danc is it whi , said the gryphon , you first form into a line along the sea-shore— two line cri the mock turtl . seal , turtl , salmon , and so on then , when you ve clear all the jelly-fish out of the way— that gener take some time , interrupt the gryphon . —you advanc twice— each with a lobster as a partner cri the gryphon . of cours , the mock turtl said advanc twice , set to partners— —chang lobster , and retir in same order , continu the gryphon . then , you know , the mock turtl went on , you throw the— the lobster shout the gryphon , with a bound into the air . —a far out to sea as you can— swim after them scream the gryphon . turn a somersault in the sea cri the mock turtl , caper wildli about . chang lobster again yell the gryphon at the top of it voic . back to land again , and that s all the first figur , said the mock turtl , suddenli drop hi voic and the two creatur , who had been jump about like mad thing all thi time , sat down again veri sadli and quietli , and look at alic . it must be a veri pretti danc , said alic timidli . would you like to see a littl of it said the mock turtl . veri much inde , said alic . come , let s tri the first figur said the mock turtl to the gryphon . we can do without lobster , you know . which shall sing oh , you sing , said the gryphon . i ve forgotten the word . so they began solemnli danc round and round alic , everi now and then tread on her toe when they pass too close , and wave their forepaw to mark the time , while the mock turtl sang thi , veri slowli and sadly— will you walk a littl faster said a white to a snail . there s a porpois close behind us , and he s tread on my tail . see how eagerli the lobster and the turtl all advanc they are wait on the shingle—wil you come and join the danc will you , won t you ,

over crumb . you re wrong about the crumb , said the mock turtl crumb would all wash off in the sea . but they have their tail in their mouth and the reason is— here the mock turtl yawn and shut hi eyes.—tel her about the reason and all that , he said to the gryphon . the reason is , said the gryphon , that they would go with the lobster to the danc . so they got thrown out to sea . so they had

first , the two creatur got so close to her , one on each side , and open their eye and mouth so veri wide , but she gain courag as she went on . her listen were perfectli quiet till she got to the part about her repeat you are old , father william , to the caterpillar , and the word all come differ , and then the mock turtl drew a long breath , and said that s veri curiou . it s all about as curiou as it can be , said the gryphon . it all came differ the mock turtl repeat thought . i should like to hear her tri and repeat someth now . tell her to begin . he look at the gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of author over alic . stand up and repeat ‘ ti the voic of the sluggard , said the gryphon . how the creatur order one about , and make one repeat lesson thought alic i might as well be at school at onc . howev , she got up , and began to repeat it , but her head wa so full of the lobster quadril , that she hardli knew what she wa say , and the word came veri queer indeed— ti the voic of the lobster i heard him declar , you have bake me too brown , i must sugar my hair . as a duck with it eyelid , so he with hi nose trim hi belt and hi button , and turn out hi toe . [ later edit continu as follow when the sand are all dri , he is gay as a lark , and will talk in contemptu tone of the shark , but , when the tide rise and shark are around , hi voic ha a timid and tremul sound . ] that s differ from what i use to say when i wa a child , said the gryphon . well , i never heard it befor , said the mock turtl but it sound uncommon nonsens . alic said noth she had sat down with her face in her hand , wonder if anyth would ever happen in a natur way again . i should like to have it explain , said the mock turtl . she can t explain it , said the gryphon hastili . go on with the next vers . but about hi toe the mock turtl persist . how could he turn them out with hi nose , you know it s the first posit in danc . alic said but wa dread puzzl by the whole thing , and long to chang the subject . go on with the next vers , the gryphon repeat impati it begin ‘ i pass by hi garden . alic did not dare to disobey , though she felt sure it would all come wrong , and she went on in a trembl voice— i pass by hi garden , and mark , with one eye , how the owl and the panther were share a pie— [ later edit continu as follow the panther took pie-crust , and gravi , and meat , while the owl had the dish as it share of the treat . when the pie wa all finish , the owl , as a boon , wa kindli permit to pocket the spoon while the panther receiv knife and fork with a growl , and conclud the banquet— ] what is the use of repeat all that stuff , the mock turtl interrupt , if you don t explain it as you go on it s by far the most confus thing i ever heard ye , i think you d better leav off , said the gryphon and alic wa onli too glad to do so . shall we tri anoth figur of the lobster quadril the gryphon went on . or would you like the mock turtl to sing you a song oh , a song , pleas , if the mock turtl would be so kind , alic repli , so eagerli that the gryphon said , in a rather offend tone , hm no account for tast sing her ‘ turtl soup , will you , old fellow the mock turtl sigh deepli , and began , in a voic sometim choke with sob , to sing this— beauti soup , so rich and green , wait in a hot tureen who for such dainti would not stoop soup of the even , beauti soup soup of the even , beauti soup beau—ooti soo—oop beau—ooti soo—oop soo—oop of the e—e—even , beauti , beauti soup beauti soup who care for fish , game , or ani other dish who would

, and the mock turtl had just begun to repeat it , when a cri of the trial s begin wa heard in the distanc . come on cri the gryphon , and , take alic by the hand , it hurri off , without wait for the end of the song . what trial is it alic pant as she ran but the gryphon onli answer come on and ran the faster , while more and more faintli came , carri on the breez that follow them , the melancholi words— soo—oop of the e—e—even , beauti , beauti soup chapter xi . who stole the tart the king and queen of heart were seat on their throne when they arriv , with a great crowd assembl about them—al sort of littl bird and beast , as well as the whole pack of card the knave wa stand befor them , in chain , with a soldier on each side to guard him and near the king wa the white rabbit , with a trumpet in one hand , and a scroll of parchment in the other . in the veri middl of the court wa a tabl , with a larg dish of tart upon it they look so good , that it made alic quit hungri to look at them—i wish they d get the trial done , she thought , and hand round the refresh but there seem to be no chanc of thi , so she began look at everyth about her , to pass away the time . alic had never been in a court of justic befor , but she had read about them in book , and she wa quit pleas to find that she knew the name of nearli everyth there . that s the judg , she said to herself , becaus of hi great wig . the judg , by the way , wa the king and as he wore hi crown over the wig , look at the frontispiec if you want to see how he did it , he did not look at all comfort , and it wa certainli not becom . and that s the jury-box , thought alic , and those twelv creatur , she wa oblig to say creatur , you see , becaus some of them were anim , and some were bird , i suppos they are the juror . she said thi last word two or three time over to herself , be rather proud of it for she thought , and rightli too , that veri few littl girl of her age knew the mean of it at all . howev , jury-men would have done just as well . the twelv juror were all write veri busili on slate . what are they do alic whisper to the gryphon . they can t have anyth to put down yet , befor the trial s begun . they re put down their name , the gryphon whisper in repli , for fear they should forget them befor the end of the trial . stupid thing alic began in a loud , indign voic , but she stop hastili , for the white rabbit cri out , silenc in the court and the king put on hi spectacl and look anxious round , to make out who wa talk . alic could see , as well as if she were look over their shoulder , that all the juror were write down stupid thing on their slate , and she could even make out that one of them didn t know how to spell stupid , and that he had to ask hi neighbour to tell him . a nice muddl their slate ll be in befor the trial s over thought alic . one of the juror had a pencil that squeak . thi of cours , alic could not stand , and she went round the court and got behind him , and veri soon found an opportun of take it away . she did it so quickli that the poor littl juror it wa bill , the lizard could not make out at all what had becom of it so , after hunt all about for it , he wa oblig to write with one finger for the rest of the day and thi wa of veri littl use , as it left no mark on the slate . herald , read the accus said the king . on thi the white rabbit blew three blast on the trumpet , and then unrol the parchment scroll , and read as follows— the queen of heart , she made some tart , all on a summer day the knave of heart , he stole those tart , and took them quit away consid your verdict , the king said to the juri . not yet , not yet the rabbit hastili interrupt . there s a great deal to come befor that call the first wit , said the king and the white rabbit blew three blast on the trumpet , and call out , first wit the first wit wa the hatter . he came in with a teacup in one hand and a piec of bread-and-butt in the other . i beg pardon , your majesti , he began , for bring these in but i hadn t quit finish my tea when i wa sent for . you ought to have finish , said the king . when did you begin the hatter look at the march hare , who had follow him into the court , arm-in-arm with the dormous . fourteenth of march , i think it wa , he said . fifteenth , said the march hare . sixteenth , ad the dormous . write that down , the king said to the juri , and the juri eagerli wrote down all three date on their slate , and then ad them up , and reduc the answer to shill and penc . take off your hat , the king said to the hatter . it isn t mine , said the hatter . stolen the king exclaim , turn to the juri , who instantli made a memorandum of the fact . i keep them to sell , the hatter ad as an explan i ve none of my own . i m a hatter . here the queen put on her spectacl , and began stare at the hatter , who turn pale and fidget . give your evid , said the king and don t be nervou , or i ll have you execut on the spot . thi did not seem to encourag the wit at all he kept shift from one foot to the other , look uneasili at the queen , and in hi confus he bit a larg piec out of hi teacup instead of the bread-and-butt . just at thi moment alic felt a veri curiou sensat , which puzzl her a good deal until she made out what it wa she wa begin to grow larger again , and she thought at first she would get up and leav the court but on second thought she decid to remain where she wa as long as there wa room for her . i wish you wouldn t squeez so . said the dormous , who wa sit next to her . i can hardli breath . i can t help it , said alic veri meekli i m grow . you ve no right to grow here , said the dormous . don t talk nonsens , said alic more boldli you know you re grow too . ye , but i grow at a reason pace , said the dormous not in that ridicul fashion . and he got up veri sulkili and cross over to the other side of the court . all thi time the queen had never left off stare at the hatter , and , just as the dormous cross the court , she said to one of the offic of the court , bring me the list of the singer in the last concert on which the wretch hatter trembl so , that he shook both hi shoe off . give your evid , the king repeat angrili , or i ll have you execut , whether you re nervou or not . i m a poor man , your majesti , the hatter began , in a trembl voic , —and i hadn t begun my tea—not abov a week or so—and what with the bread-and-butt get so thin—and the twinkl of the tea— the twinkl of the what said the king . it began with the tea , the hatter repli . of cours twinkl begin with a t said the king sharpli . do you take me for a dunc go on i m a poor man , the hatter went on , and most thing twinkl after that—onli the march hare said— i didn t the march hare interrupt in a great hurri . you did said the hatter . i deni it said the march hare . he deni it , said the king leav out that part . well , at ani rate , the dormous said— the hatter went on , look anxious round to see if he would deni it too but the dormous deni noth , be fast asleep . after that , continu the hatter , i cut some more bread-and-butter— but what did the dormous say one of the juri ask . that i can t rememb , said the hatter . you must rememb , remark the king , or i ll have you execut . the miser hatter drop hi teacup and bread-and-butt , and went down on one knee . i m a poor man , your majesti , he began . you re a veri poor speaker , said the king . here one of the guinea-pig cheer , and wa immedi suppress by the offic of the court . as that is rather a hard word , i will just explain to you how it wa done . they had a larg canva bag , which tie up at the mouth with string into thi they slip the guinea-pig , head first , and then sat upon it . i m glad i ve seen that done , thought alic . i ve so often read in the newspap , at the end of trial , there wa some attempt at applaus , which wa immedi suppress by the offic of the court , and i never understood what it meant till now . if that s all you know about it , you may stand down , continu the king . i can t go no lower , said the hatter i m on the floor , as it is . then you may sit down , the king repli . here the other guinea-pig cheer , and wa suppress . come , that finish the guinea-pig thought alic . now we shall get on better . i d rather finish my tea , said the hatter , with an anxiou look at the queen , who wa read the list of singer . you may go , said the king , and the hatter hurriedli left the court , without even wait to put hi shoe on . —and just take hi head off outsid , the queen ad to one of the offic but the hatter wa out of sight befor the offic could get to the door . call the next wit said the king . the next wit wa the duchess s cook . she carri the pepper-box in her hand , and alic guess who it wa , even befor she got into the court , by the way the peopl near the door began sneez all at onc . give your evid , said the king . shan t , said the cook . the king look anxious at the white rabbit , who said in a low voic , your majesti must cross-examin thi wit . well , if i must , i must , the king said , with a melancholi air , and , after fold hi arm and frown at the cook till hi eye were nearli out of sight , he said in a deep voic , what are tart made of pepper , mostli , said the cook . treacl , said a sleepi voic behind her . collar that dormous , the queen shriek out . behead that dormous turn that dormous out of court suppress him pinch him off with hi whisker for some minut the whole court wa in confus , get the dormous turn out , and , by the time they had settl down again , the cook had disappear . never mind said the king , with an air of great relief . call the next wit . and he ad in an underton to the queen , realli , my dear , you must cross-examin the next wit . it quit make my forehead ach alic watch the white rabbit as he fumbl over the list , feel veri curiou to see what the next wit would be like , —for they haven t got much evid yet , she said to herself . imagin her surpris , when the white rabbit read out , at the top of hi shrill littl voic , the name alic chapter xii . alic s evid here cri alic , quit forget in the flurri of the moment how larg she had grown in the last few minut , and she jump up in such a hurri that she tip over the jury-box with the edg of her skirt , upset all the jurymen on to the head of the crowd below , and there they lay sprawl about , remind her veri much of a globe of goldfish she had accident upset the week befor . oh , i beg your pardon she exclaim in a tone of great dismay , and began pick them up again as quickli as she could , for the accid of the goldfish kept run in her head , and she had a vagu sort of idea that they must be collect at onc and put back into the jury-box , or they would die . the trial can not proceed , said the king in a veri grave voic , until all the jurymen are back in their proper places—al , he repeat with great emphasi , look hard at alic as he said so . alic look at the jury-box , and saw that , in her hast , she had put the lizard in head downward , and the poor littl thing wa wave it tail about in a melancholi way , be quit unabl to move . she soon got it out again , and put it right not that it signifi much , she said to herself i should think it would be quit as much use in the trial one way up as the other . as soon as the juri had a littl recov from the shock of be upset , and their slate and pencil had been found and hand back to them , they set to work veri dilig to write out a histori of the accid , all except the lizard , who seem too much overcom to do anyth but sit with it mouth open , gaze up into the roof of the court . what do you know about thi busi the king said to alic . noth , said alic . noth whatev persist the king . noth whatev , said alic . that s veri import , the king said , turn to the juri . they were just begin to write thi down on their slate , when the white rabbit interrupt unimport , your majesti mean , of cours , he said in a veri respect tone , but frown and make face at him as he spoke . unimport , of cours , i meant , the king hastili said , and went on to himself in an underton , important—unimportant—unimportant—important— as if he were tri which word sound best . some of the juri wrote it down import , and some unimport . alic could see thi , as she wa near enough to look over their slate but it doesn t matter a bit , she thought to herself . at thi moment the king , who had been for some time busili write in hi note-book , cackl out silenc and read out from hi book , rule forty-two . all person more than a mile high to leav the court . everybodi look at alic . i m not a mile high , said alic . you are , said the king . nearli two mile high , ad the queen . well , i shan t go , at ani rate , said alic besid , that s not a regular rule you invent it just now . it s the oldest rule in the book , said the king . then it ought to be number one , said alic . the king turn pale , and shut hi note-book hastili . consid your verdict , he said to the juri , in a low , trembl voic . there s more evid to come yet , pleas your majesti , said the white rabbit , jump up in a great hurri thi paper ha just been pick up . what s in it said the queen . i haven t open it yet , said the white rabbit , but it seem to be a letter , written by the prison to—to somebodi . it must have been that , said the king , unless it wa written to nobodi , which isn t usual , you know . who is it direct to said one of the jurymen . it isn t direct at all , said the white rabbit in fact , there s noth written on the outsid . he unfold the paper as he spoke , and ad it isn t a letter , after all it s a set of vers . are they in the prison s handwrit ask anoth of the jurymen . no , they re not , said the white rabbit , and that s the queerest thing about it . the juri all look puzzl . he must have imit somebodi els s hand , said the king . the juri all brighten up again . pleas your majesti , said the knave , i didn t write it , and they can t prove i did there s no name sign at the end . if you didn t sign it , said the king , that onli make the matter wors . you must have meant some mischief , or els you d have sign your name like an honest man . there wa a gener clap of hand at thi it wa the first realli clever thing the king had said that day . that prove hi guilt , said the queen . it prove noth of the sort said alic . whi , you don t even know what they re about read them , said the king . the white rabbit put on hi spectacl . where shall i begin , pleas your majesti he ask . begin at the begin , the king said grave , and go on till you come to the end then stop . these were the vers the white rabbit read— they told me you had been to her , and mention me to him she gave me a good charact , but said i could not swim . he sent them word i had not gone we know it to be true if she should push the matter on , what would becom of you i gave her one , they gave him two , you gave us three or more they all return from him to you , though they were mine befor . if i or she should chanc to be involv in thi affair , he trust to you to set them free , exactli as we were . my notion wa that you had been befor she had thi fit an obstacl that came between him , and ourselv , and it . don t let him know she like them best , for thi must ever be a secret , kept from all the rest , between yourself and me . that s the most import piec of evid we ve heard yet , said the king , rub hi hand so now let the jury— if ani one of them can explain it , said alic , she had grown so larg in the last few minut that she wasn t a bit afraid of interrupt him , i ll give him sixpenc . i don t believ there s an atom of mean in it . the juri all wrote down on their slate , she doesn t believ there s an atom of mean in it , but none of them attempt to explain the paper . if there s no mean in it , said the king , that save a world of troubl , you know , as we needn t tri to find ani . and yet i don t know , he went on , spread out the vers on hi knee , and look at them with one eye i seem to see some mean in them , after all . —said i could not swim— you can t swim , can you he ad , turn to the knave . the knave shook hi head sadli . do i look like it he said . which he certainli did not , be made entir of cardboard . all right , so far , said the king , and he went on mutter over the vers to himself ‘ we know it to be true— that s the juri , of course— ‘ i gave her one , they gave him two— whi , that must be what he did with the tart , you know— but , it goe on ‘ they all return from him to you , said alic . whi , there they are said the king triumphantli , point to the tart on the tabl . noth can be clearer than that . then again— ‘ befor she had thi fit— you never had fit , my dear , i think he said to the queen . never said the queen furious , throw an inkstand at the lizard as she spoke . the unfortun littl bill had left off write on hi slate with one finger , as he found it made no mark but he now hastili began again , use the ink , that wa trickl down hi face , as long as it last . then the word don t fit you , said the king , look round the court with a smile . there wa a dead silenc . it s a pun the king ad in an offend tone , and everybodi laugh , let the juri consid their verdict , the king said , for about the twentieth time that day . no , no said the queen . sentenc first—verdict afterward . stuff and nonsens said alic loudli . the idea of have the sentenc first hold your tongu said the queen , turn purpl . i won t said alic . off with her head the queen shout at the top of her voic . nobodi move . who care for you said alic , she had grown to her full size by thi time . you re noth but a pack of card at thi the whole pack rose up into the air , and came fli down upon her she gave a littl scream , half of fright and half of anger , and tri to beat them off , and found herself lie on the bank , with her head in the lap of her sister , who wa gentli brush away some dead leav that had flutter down from the tree upon her face . wake up , alic dear said her sister whi , what a long sleep you ve had oh , i ve had such a curiou dream said alic , and she told her sister , as well as she could rememb them , all these strang adventur of her that you have just been read about and when she had finish , her sister kiss her , and said , it wa a curiou dream , dear , certainli but now run in to your tea it s get late . so alic got up and ran off , think while she ran , as well she might , what a wonder dream it had been . but her sister sat still just as she left her , lean her head on her hand , watch the set sun , and think of littl alic and all her wonder adventur , till she too began dream after a fashion , and thi wa her dream— first , she dream of littl alic herself , and onc again the tini hand were clasp upon her knee , and the bright eager eye were look up into hers—sh could hear the veri tone of her voic , and see that queer littl toss of her head to keep back the wander hair that would alway get into her eyes—and still as she listen , or seem to listen , the whole place around her becam aliv with the strang creatur of her littl sister s dream . the long grass rustl at her feet as the white rabbit hurri by—th frighten mous splash hi way through the neighbour pool—sh could hear the rattl of the teacup as the march hare and hi friend share their never-end meal , and the shrill voic of the queen order off her unfortun guest to execution—onc more the pig-babi wa sneez on the duchess s knee , while plate and dish crash around it—onc more the shriek of the gryphon , the squeak of the lizard s slate-pencil , and the choke of the suppress guinea-pig , fill the air , mix up with the distant sob of the miser mock turtl . so she sat on , with close eye , and half believ herself in wonderland , though she knew she had but to open them again , and all would chang to dull reality—th grass would be onli rustl in the wind , and the pool rippl to the wave of the reeds—th rattl teacup would chang to tinkl sheep-bel , and the queen s shrill cri to the voic of the shepherd boy—and the sneez of the babi , the shriek of the gryphon , and all the other queer nois , would chang she knew to the confus clamour of the busi farm-yard—whil the low of the cattl in the distanc would take the place of the mock turtl s heavi sob . lastli , she pictur to herself how thi same littl sister of her would , in the after-tim , be herself a grown woman and how she would keep , through all her riper year , the simpl and love heart of her childhood and how she would gather about her other littl children , and make their eye bright and eager with mani a strang tale , perhap even with the dream of wonderland of long ago and how she would feel with all their simpl sorrow , and find a pleasur in all their simpl joy , rememb her own child-lif , and the happi summer day . \n"
